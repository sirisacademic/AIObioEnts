{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>In addition, heavy workloads, lack of salary and career incentives, and lack of policy and funding support are all barriers to CPD.</Species>", "label": []}

{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>The primary limitation employers faced was the lack of financial resources, however giving employees time off without pay was an alternative strategy utilized instead of funding professional development activities.</Species>", "label": []}

{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>Second, almost none of the strategies were specifically developed for rehabilitation professionals and in many cases had to be re-worded to fit the rehabilitation context.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>There is a lack of research on rehabilitation clinicians' perspectives on recruitment and retention strategies; therefore future research should focus on investigating this area.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>Third, during the face-to-face meeting, bias could have resulted from panelists whose opinion may have influenced others significantly, especially if members came from similar workplace settings.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>The facilitator of the expert panels however, followed a strict process for managing the discussion and ensured that all panelists were given the opportunity to express their opinions.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>Finally, although some strategies such as competitive wage packages, training/growth opportunities and professional development are viewed as both a recruitment and retention incentive, other strategies do not overlap and are appropriate for only one of the two tasks.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "2636785", "text": "<Species>For example, increasing public awareness of rehabilitation careers, providing rural and remote orientation packages and family relocation programs are only appropriate for attracting a worker while ensuring open and timely communication may be seen as a strategy only for retention.</Species>", "label": []}

{"id": "509286", "text": "<Species>During that time, the dominant conceptual models guiding intervention development have been cognitive behavior models that have their origin in psychological theory.</Species>", "label": []}

{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>The data presented here demonstrate two main points regarding the biochemical associations and function of Scp160p in yeast.</Species>", "label": [[127, 132, "Species"]]}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>First, the sucrose gradient fractionation data clearly demonstrate that Scp160p exists primarily associated with large complexes, likely to be polyribosomes.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>To our knowledge, this is the first time a vigilin family member has been shown to associate with polyribosomes in this manner.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Interestingly, Weber and colleagues did not observe sucrose gradient fractionation data consistent with polyribosome association of Scp160p (5).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>These authors hypothesized that Scp160p associates only with membrane-bound polyribosomes, and that Scp160p is not found complexed with cytosolic polyribosomes (5).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Our data do not support this hypothesis, since unlike Weber and colleagues, we were able to detect significant amounts of Scp160p associated with polyribosomes without using detergents during preparation.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>First, the lysate buffer utilized by that group contained 100 mM NaCl, whereas our buffer contained 50 mM KCl.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Our data shown in Figure 3 suggest that 100 mM NaCl may have caused an instability in the Scp160p-RNA interaction, leading to release from polyribosomes during their procedure.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Secondly, Weber   s lysate buffer reportedly contained heparin to inhibit ribonucleases; a number of reports (28,29) suggest that heparin can disrupt RNA-protein interactions.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Although we have not in the past included heparin in any of our experiments, we have observed disruption of the polyribosome association in buffer containing residual diethylpyrocarbonate, another inhibitor of ribonucleases (data not shown).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Second, our data provide compelling evidence that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP complex.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Since Scp160p does not remain associated with either single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits following treatment with EDTA or RNase, it seems unlikely that Scp160p is a constitutive component of the translational machinery.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Partial purification of the EDTA-resistant Scp160p complexes allowed us to demonstrate the presence of Pab1p but not Pub1p in these preparations, which is consistent with the idea that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of mRNP complexes.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Previously, Scp160p had been shown to bind ribohomopolymers and rRNA in vitro, although the in vivo nucleic acid targets of Scp160p were unknown (5).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>The presence of Pab1p in RNase-sensitive Scp160p complexes indicates that Scp160p is primarily bound to polyadenylated RNAs.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Whether or not Scp160p binds only specific sets of mRNAs will be the subject of future studies.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>In addition to Scp160p and Pab1p, we have identified a third component of the complex, the protein Bfr1p.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>The gene, BFR1, was originally identified in a screen for high-copy suppressors of Brefeldin-A induced lethality, suggesting a role in the secretory pathway (16).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Interestingly, however, bfr1 null mutants do not demonstrate any defects in the secretory pathway, but rather display similar phenotypes to scp160 null mutants, most notably increased ploidy and increased cell size (16).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>It is therefore unclear whether Bfr1p is capable of functioning in both RNA metabolism and secretion directly, or if the Scp160p-Bfr1p complex regulates the expression of one or more secretory genes at the post-transcriptional level.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Additionally, two-hybrid analysis indicated an interaction of Bfr1p with the protein Bbp1p, a component of the mitotic spindle apparatus (30).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>While Bbp1p is an essential gene, overexpression leads to a phenotype similar to both bfr1 and scp160 null strains (30).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Future work will address the functional relationship between Scp160p and Bfr1p including the possibility that these proteins represent a regulatory mechanism connecting the translational machinery with cell division and/or the secretory pathway.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Following treatment with either RNase or >150 mM NaCl, Scp160p remained as an apparent ~450 kDa species.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Considering that purified Scp160p alone also migrates at this size, we conclude that this apparent complex may consist only of Scp160p, although the presence of other small components cannot be ruled out at this time.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Furthermore, by utilizing yeast co-expressing two distinct epitope-tagged versions of Scp160p, we have ruled out the possibility of self-association of Scp160p.</Species>", "label": [[35, 40, "Species"]]}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Although both tagged proteins appear functional, it remains a formal possibility that the tags somehow prevented formation of FLAG-HA hetero-complexes.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>Nonetheless, it seems most likely that native Scp160p monomers may simply migrate aberrantly under native conditions due to an unusual shape or some other physical property.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>In conclusion we have shown convincing evidence that Scp160p exists in yeast cytoplasmic extracts primarily associated with polyribosomes.</Species>", "label": [[80, 85, "Species"]]}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>We have purified Scp160p following disruption of polyribosomes with EDTA, and identified two associated proteins: Pab1p and Bfr1p.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "102792", "text": "<Species>The presence of Pab1p suggests that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP, demonstrating Scp160p to be the first S.cerevisiae multiple-KH domain protein characterized to function in this way.</Species>", "label": [[148, 160, "Species"]]}

{"id": "1551914", "text": "<Species>Certain other factors increased the risk of a blood clot even more, such as having a particular mutation (known as factor V Leiden) in a gene involved in blood clotting, having a body mass index of more than 30 kg/m2 (over 30 kg/m2 is defined as being obese), being more than 1.90 meters tall, and using oral contraceptives.</Species>", "label": []}

{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>DISCUSSION</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>Although the original multiplex protocol was based on a set of tagged vectors (3), tagged primers have also been used or proposed for various forms of multiplex DNA sequencing (George Church, personal communication; 2, 27).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>For example, a proposal was recently put forward for multiplex sequencing using sequence-labelled primers and fluorophor-labelled probes (1), similar in principle to the methods used here.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>However, we use tagged primers and the superposition of the four sequencing reactions to address the problem of reading DNA sequence films; a part of this solution is to utilize M13 dideoxynucleotide sequencing, thereby improving the quality of the data to be analyzed.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>In addition, the proposal for fluorophor-labelled probes does not take into consideration any of the practical sequencing problems addressed here, and, in the version described, remains a promising but unproven scheme for large scale DNA sequencing.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>There are several advantages to tagging primers instead of vectors.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>Firstly, there is no need to prepare multiple libraries of clones in special vectors.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>This means that workers can use vector/host combinations that yield good results in their hands, and an increased depth of multiplexing can easily be accomodated by synthesizing more primers.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>This should make multiplexing more accessible to workers undertaking smaller projects.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>A theoretical disadvantage of tagged primers is that the procedure can only be multiplexed following primer annealing (1), or following the sequencing reactions (this paper; in practice, pooling immediately after the annealing step might lead to increased backgrounds if one or more primers were present in excess over their template DNAs).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>This is a relatively late stage.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>In the original procedure (3), clones were pooled prior to amplification by growth, an early step.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>However, we do not believe the sacrifice to be of practical importance when using phage vectors.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>In our experience, recombinant M13 phage have variable growth rates and the effects of competition are likely to severely limit the number of clones that can usefully be pooled for growth.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>In contrast, by growing clones individually, the depth of multiplexing is only really limited by probe sensitivity.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>We have not investigated the factors influencing variability in phage growth rates.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>It is worth noting that reliable protocols have been developed for growing large numbers of individual M13 clones and preparing high quality ssDNA templates in microtitre trays (28, 21).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>It is relatively simple to prepare manually two microtitre trays of ssDNA templates (192 clones) in a day.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>Sufficient clones can be prepared in a week to sequence a 20kb fragment to a redundancy of 10 (Victoria Smith, personal communication).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>In this laboratory, ssDNA is now prepared with the aid of a commercially available robotic workstation (21).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>As sequencing reactions are also carried out in microtitre trays, manually or robotically (20, 29), the entire M13-based dideoxynucleotide sequencing procedure is amenable to automation (29).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>For these reasons we see little practical advantage in pooling clones early.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>Finally, by not pooling clones early, the ability to easily retrieve individual clones is retained, which may facilitate directed sequencing later in a project should this become necessary.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>Multiplex DNA sequencing is currently limited by the lack of a robust computer program which can correct for the large variety of gel and sequencing artefacts that are normally encountered.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>The foundation of a film reading program is the ability to bring into register precisely vertical arrays of base-specific bands.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>This requires the ability to track lanes, correct for distortions, and order bands based on their relative spacing.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>A method of sequencing which has successfully overcome the problem of sequence reading uses real-time detection of fluorescently labelled DNA samples migrating through the gel (2).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>This system also utilizes the principle of running the four base reactions down the same lane (2).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>However, bands are detected at a fixed location in space, and their detection is separated in time.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>Hence the Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 19, No. 12 3305 problem of gel distortion is essentially avoided, although corrections for the different mobilities of the four dyes must be carried out.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>In contrast, we utilize the advantages of single lane electrophoresis to address the problem of superimposing four relatively large and complex two-dimensional images.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>Furthermore, by using sequence-tagged oligonucleotides which are detected by hybridization, a much greater depth of multiplexing can realistically be achieved than by real-time detection.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>The use of two-dimensional colour traces to depict the processed output of a film reader is consistent with the method of displaying fluorescence traces, and should facilitate the checking and editing of sequence databases in which both kinds of data have been entered.</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>The sequence compilation programs used in this laboratory, which are already capable of handling large shotgun databases (8, 31), have recently undergone extensive improvements (Rodger Staden, personal communication).</Species>", "label": []}
{"id": "328326", "text": "<Species>There is now an interactive database editor which allows the graphical display of fluorescence traces, and it is envisaged that this feature could be extended to allow the handling of data from a film reader when a suitable machine is developed.</Species>", "label": []}
