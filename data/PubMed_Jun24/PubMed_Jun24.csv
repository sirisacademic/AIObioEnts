38885923,Glucose-induced endocytic degradation of the maltose transporter MalP is mediated through ubiquitination by the HECT-ubiquitin ligase HulA and its adaptor CreD in Aspergillus oryzae.,"In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, large amounts of amylolytic enzymes are inducibly produced by isomaltose, which is converted from maltose incorporated via the maltose transporter MalP. In contrast, the preferred sugar glucose strongly represses the expression of both amylolytic and malP genes through carbon catabolite repression. Simultaneously, the addition of glucose triggers the endocytic degradation of MalP on the plasma membrane. In budding yeast, the signal-dependent ubiquitin modification of plasma membrane transporters leads to selective endocytosis into the vacuole for degradation. In addition, during glucose-induced MalP degradation, the homologous of E6AP C-terminus-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (HulA) is responsible for the ubiquitin modification of MalP, and the arrestin-like protein CreD is required for HulA targeting. Although CreD-mediated MalP internalization occurs in response to glucose, the mechanism by which CreD regulates HulA-dependent MalP ubiquitination remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that three (P/L)PxY motifs present in the CreD protein are essential for functioning as HulA adaptors so that HulA can recognize MalP in response to glucose stimulation, enabling MalP internalization. Furthermore, four lysine residues (three highly conserved among Aspergillus species and yeast and one conserved among Aspergillus species) of CreD were found to be necessary for its ubiquitination, resulting in efficient glucose-induced MalP endocytosis. The results of this study pave the way for elucidating the regulatory mechanism of MalP endocytic degradation through ubiquitination by the HulA-CreD complex at the molecular level."
38885924,Bifidobacterium bifidum strain BB1 inhibits TNF-α-induced increase in intestinal epithelial tight junction permeability via TLR-2/TLR-6 receptor complex-dependent stimulation of PPAR-γ and suppression of NF-kB p65.,"Bifidobacterium bifidum (BB) strain BB1 causes a strain-specific enhancement in intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier. TNF-α induces an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability and promotes intestinal inflammation. The major purpose of this study was to delineate the protective effect of BB1 against the TNF-α induced increase in intestinal TJ permeability and to unravel the intracellular mechanisms involved. Previously reported, TNF-α produces an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability in Caco-2 monolayers and in mice. The addition of BB1 inhibited the TNF-α increase in Caco-2 intestinal TJ permeability and mouse intestinal permeability in a strain-specific manner. BB1 inhibited the TNF-α induced increase in intestinal TJ permeability by interfering the with TNF-α induced enterocyte NF-κB p50/p65 and MLCK gene activation. The BB1 protective effect against the TNF-α induced increase in intestinal permeability was mediated by TLR-2/TLR-6 heterodimer complex activation of PPAR-γ and PPAR-γ pathway inhibition of TNF-α induced IKK-α activation, which in turn resulted in a step-wise inhibition of NF-κB p50/p65, MLCK gene, MLCK kinase activity, MLCK-induced opening of the TJ barrier. In conclusion, these studies unravel novel intracellular mechanisms of BB1 protection against the TNF-α induced increase in intestinal TJ permeability. Our data show that BB1 protects against the TNF-α induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability via a PPAR-γ dependent inhibition of NF-κB p50/p65 and MLCK gene activation."
38887902,DifferentialRegulation: a Bayesian hierarchical approach to identify differentially regulated genes.,"Although transcriptomics data is typically used to analyze mature spliced mRNA, recent attention has focused on jointly investigating spliced and unspliced (or precursor-) mRNA, which can be used to study gene regulation and changes in gene expression production. Nonetheless, most methods for spliced/unspliced inference (such as RNA velocity tools) focus on individual samples, and rarely allow comparisons between groups of samples (e.g. healthy vs. diseased). Furthermore, this kind of inference is challenging, because spliced and unspliced mRNA abundance is characterized by a high degree of quantification uncertainty, due to the prevalence of multi-mapping reads, ie reads compatible with multiple transcripts (or genes), and/or with both their spliced and unspliced versions. Here, we present DifferentialRegulation, a Bayesian hierarchical method to discover changes between experimental conditions with respect to the relative abundance of unspliced mRNA (over the total mRNA). We model the quantification uncertainty via a latent variable approach, where reads are allocated to their gene/transcript of origin, and to the respective splice version. We designed several benchmarks where our approach shows good performance, in terms of sensitivity and error control, vs. state-of-the-art competitors. Importantly, our tool is flexible, and works with both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. DifferentialRegulation is distributed as a Bioconductor R package."
38886966,"Exploring the Interplay between Vitamin D, Insulin Resistance, Obesity and Skeletal Health.","Vitamin D (ViD), plays an important role in calcium absorption and bone mineralization, is associated with bone mineral density. Severe deficiency in ViD has long been linked to conditions such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, revealing its substantial role in skeletal health. Additionally, investigations show an existing interconnection between ViD and insulin resistance (Ins-R), especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Obesity, in conjunction with Ins-R, may augment the risk of osteoporosis and deterioration of skeletal health. This review aims to examine recent studies on the interplay between ViD, Ins-R, obesity, and their impact on skeletal health, to offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies. Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Pubmed were searched to investigate relevant studies until December 2023. Current research demonstrates ViD's impact on pancreatic β-cell function, systemic inflammation, and insulin action regulation. Our findings highlight an intricate association between ViD, Ins-R, obesity, and skeletal health, providing a perspective for the prevention and/or treatment of skeletal disorders in patients with obesity, Ins-R, and T2DM."
38887533,Feasibility of a virtual reality course on adult tracheostomy safety skills.,"The National Tracheostomy Safety Project has run high-quality, face-to-face skills courses since 2009. The aim of this project was to produce a virtual reality version of the established course and evaluate its impact on participant learning, and participant and faculty satisfaction. Healthcare staff and students were recruited and randomised to attend one of (1) a face-to-face traditional course (control); (2) a virtual reality course at a conference centre with on-site technical support; (3) a fully remote virtual reality course; the virtual reality groups were combined for the analysis of learning outcomes and satisfaction. The primary outcome was the difference in pre/post-course knowledge scores on a 30-item questionnaire; secondary outcomes included knowledge retention, usability, comfort/side effects and participant performance in a simulated tracheostomy emergency. Thirty-seven participants and 15 faculty participated in this study. There was no significant difference between mean pre/post-course scores from the face-to-face (from 21.1 to 23.1; +2) and combined virtual reality (from 17.1 to 21.1; +4) groups, with both showing improvement (p = 0.21). The mean System Usability Scale score for virtual reality was 76.8 (SD 12.6), which is above average; the median Simulator Sickness Questionnaire score was 7.5 (IQR 3.7-22.4), indicating minimal symptoms. All participants resolved the primary clinical problem in the simulated emergency, but the virtual reality (VR) group was slower overall (mean difference 61.8 s, p = 0.003). This technical feasibility study demonstrated that there was no difference in participant knowledge immediately after and 4 weeks following face-to-face and virtual reality courses. Virtual reality offers an immersive experience that can be delivered remotely and offers potential benefits of reducing travel and venue costs for attendees, therefore increasing the flexibility of training opportunities."
38887745,Breaking the Cycle: Addressing Period Poverty as a Critical Public Health Challenge and Its Relation to Sustainable Development Goals.,"This narrative review comprehensively examines the intricate relationship between period poverty and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), positioning it as a critical public health challenge with far-reaching implications. Through an in-depth analysis of the multifaceted impact of period poverty on public health, including its effects on reproductive health, mental well-being, and economic participation, the paper underscores the urgent need to address this issue within the framework of the SDGs. An overview of existing literature on period poverty, its impact on health and well-being, and its relation to the SDGs was carried out. Different perspectives, interventions, and policy approaches to addressing period poverty were also explored. By illuminating the interplay between period poverty and various SDGs, particularly those related to gender equality, health, education, and economic empowerment, the study emphasizes the imperative of integrating menstrual health and hygiene into global development efforts. Advocating for targeted policies, funding, and advocacy, the manuscript calls for a holistic and inclusive approach to breaking the cycle of period poverty, ultimately contributing to advancing the SDGs and fostering a more equitable and healthier global society. Efforts to eradicate period poverty - providing affordable menstrual products, improving sanitation infrastructure, enhancing education, and implementing supportive policies - lead to significant progress in public health and gender equity. By prioritizing menstrual health management in public health policies, educational programs, and economic strategies, we can ensure that everyone who menstruates can do so with dignity and without limits on their potential."
38886253,Assessing the relationship between delay discounting and decisions to engage in various protective behaviors during COVID-19.,"Research suggests that discounting of delayed rewards (i.e., tendency to choose smaller immediate rewards over large later rewards) is a promising target of intervention to encourage compliance with public health measures (PHM), such as vaccination compliance. The effects of delay discounting, however, may differ across the types of PHMs, given that the benefits of vaccination, unlike other PHMs (physical distancing, handwashing, and mask-wearing), are more temporally delayed. Here, we examined whether delay discounting predicts engaging in COVID-19 PHMs in approximately 7,000 participants recruited from 13 countries in June-August 2021. After controlling for demographic and distress variables, delay discounting was a negative predictor of vaccination, but a positive predictor of physical distancing (when restrictions are in place) and handwashing. There was no significant association between delay discounting and frequency of mask-wearing. It is possible that increasing vaccination compliance may require greater emphasis on future benefits of vaccination, whereas promotion of physical distancing and hand hygiene may require greater focus on the present moment. Further research is needed to investigate the nature of this relationship and its implications for public health messaging."
38885959,The pandemic preterm paradox: A test of competing explanations.,"Epidemiologists have long argued that side effects of the stress response include preterm birth. Research reports that fear of lethal infection stressed pregnant persons at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic and that ""shutdowns"" and ""social distancing"" impeded access to social support and prenatal care. The decline in preterm births in high-income countries, including the United States (US), during the early months of the pandemic therefore poses a paradox for science. Explanations of this ""pandemic preterm paradox"" remain untested. We apply time-series modeling to data describing 80 monthly conception cohorts begun in the US from July 2013 through February 2020 to determine which of 3 explanations most parsimoniously explains the paradox. We infer that ""prior loss,"" or the argument that an increase in spontaneous abortions and stillbirths depleted the population of fetuses at risk of preterm birth, best explains data currently available. We describe the implications of these results for public health practice."
38888001,Obstructive sleep apnea may induce sleep-wake cycle dysregulation: An actigraphic study.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). OSA has been hypothesised to impair the circadian sleep-wake rhythm, and this dysregulation may in turn exacerbate OSA-related diurnal symptoms. Hence, this study aimed to assess the sleep-wake rhythm through actigraphy, and its relationship with EDS in patients with untreated OSA. Patients with moderate-severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥15/h) and healthy controls (HC) underwent a 7-day actigraphic recording to evaluate the sleep-wake rhythm. Participants underwent a sleep medicine visit and completed the self-report questionnaires assessing EDS (Epworth sleepiness scale, ESS), sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index, PSQI), and chronotype (morningness-eveningness questionnaire, MEQ). This study included 48 OSA patients (72.9% males; mean age 56.48 ± 9.53 years), and 22 HC (45.5% males; mean age 53.73 ± 18.20 years). After controlling for MEQ scores, actigraphic recording showed that the OSA patients present a lower sleep time (p = 0.011) and sleep efficiency (p = 0.013), as well as a higher sleep latency (p = 0.047), and sleep fragmentation (p = 0.029) than the HC. Regarding the sleep-wake rhythm actigraphic parameters, the OSA patients showed a lower average activity during the most active 10-hour period (p = 0.036) and a lower day/night activity ratio (p = 0.007) than the HC. Patients with OSA also reported higher ESS (p = 0.005) and PSQI scores (p < 0.001), and a chronotype less of morning type (p = 0.027) than the HC. In conclusion, this study documented a reduced diurnal motor activity and lower day/night activity ratio in OSA patients than in controls. These findings suggest a dysregulation of the circadian sleep-wake rhythm in OSA, possibly related to both EDS and reduced daytime motor activity."
38886382,Topoisomerase I is an evolutionarily conserved key regulator for satellite DNA transcription.,"RNA Polymerase (RNAP) II transcription on non-coding repetitive satellite DNAs plays an important role in chromosome segregation, but a little is known about the regulation of satellite transcription. We here show that Topoisomerase I (TopI), not TopII, promotes the transcription of α-satellite DNAs, the main type of satellite DNAs on human centromeres. Mechanistically, TopI localizes to centromeres, binds RNAP II and facilitates RNAP II elongation. Interestingly, in response to DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), α-satellite transcription is dramatically stimulated in a DNA damage checkpoint-independent but TopI-dependent manner, and these DSB-induced α-satellite RNAs form into strong speckles in the nucleus. Remarkably, TopI-dependent satellite transcription also exists in mouse 3T3 and Drosophila S2 cells and in Drosophila larval imaginal wing discs and tumor tissues. Altogether, our findings herein reveal an evolutionally conserved mechanism with TopI as a key player for the regulation of satellite transcription at both cellular and animal levels."
38887981,Single-cell combined with transcriptome sequencing to explore the molecular mechanism of cell communication in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common, chronic, and progressive lung disease that severely impacts human health and survival. However, the intricate molecular underpinnings of IPF remains elusive. This study aims to delve into the nuanced molecular interplay of cellular interactions in IPF, thereby laying the groundwork for innovative therapeutic approaches in the clinical field of IPF. Sophisticated bioinformatics methods were employed to identify crucial biomarkers essential for the progression of IPF. The GSE122960 single-cell dataset was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) compendium, and intercellular communication potentialities were scrutinized via CellChat. The random survival forest paradigm was established using the GSE70866 dataset. Quintessential genes were selected through Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, while immune infiltration examinations, functional enrichment critiques and nomogram paradigms were inaugurated. Analysis of intercellular communication revealed an intimate potential connections between macrophages and various cell types, pinpointing five cardinal genes influencing the trajectory and prognosis of IPF. The nomogram paradigm, sculpted from these seminal genes, exhibits superior predictive prowess. Our research meticulously identified five critical genes, confirming their intimate association with the prognosis, immune infiltration and transcriptional governance of IPF. Interestingly, we discerned these genes' engagement with the EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION signalling pathway, which may enhance our understanding of the molecular complexity of IPF."
38887135,Unveiling the mechanisms of Moso bamboo's motor function and internal growth stress.,"Bamboo, a renewable resource with rapid growth and an impressive height-to-diameter ratio, faces mechanical instability due to its slender structure. Despite this, bamboo maintains its posture without breaking in its battle against environmental and gravitational forces. But what drives this motor function in bamboo? This study subjected Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) to gravitational stimulation, compelling it to grow at a 45° angle instead of upright. Remarkably, the artificially inclined bamboo exhibited astonishing shape control and adjustment capabilities. The growth strain was detected at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, providing evidence for the presence of internal stress, namely growth stress. The high longitudinal tensile stress on the upper side, along with a significant asymmetry in stress distribution in tilted bamboo, plays a pivotal role in maintaining its mechanical stability. Drawing upon experimental findings, it can be deduced that the growth stress primarily originates from the broad layers of fiber cells. Bamboo could potentially regulate the magnitude of growth stress by modifying the number of fiber cell layers during its maturation process. Additionally, the microfibril angle and lignin disposition may decisively influence the generation of growth stress."
38886408,Molecular phylogeny reveals Varroa mites are not a separate family but a subfamily of Laelapidae.,"Varroa mites, notorious for parasitizing honeybees, are generally classified as Varroidae. Their extremely modified morphologies and behaviors have led to debates regarding their phylogenetic position and classification as an independent family. In this study, two different datasets were employed to reconstruct the phylogenies of Varroa mites and related Laelapidae species: (1) 9257 bp from the whole 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes of 24 taxa, (2) 3158 bp from 113 taxa using Sanger sequencing of four nuclear loci. Both mitochondrial and nuclear analyses consistently place Varroa mites within the Laelapidae. Here we propose to place Varroa mites in the subfamily Varroinae stat. nov., which represents a highly morphologically adapted group within the Laelapidae. Ancestral state reconstructions reveal that bee-associated lifestyles evolved independently at least three times within Laelapidae, with most phoretic traits originating from free-living ancestors. Our revised classification and evolutionary analyses will provide new insight into understanding the Varroa mites."
38887146,Ultra-Fast Selenol-Yne Click (SYC) Reaction Enables Poly(selenoacetal) Covalent Adaptable Network Formation.,"The emergence of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) based on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) presents a promising avenue for achieving resource recovery and utilization. In this study, we discovered a novel dynamic covalent bond called selenacetal, which is obtained through a double click reaction between selenol and activated alkynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the ΔG for the formation of selenoacetals ranges from 12 to 18 kJ mol-1, suggesting its potential for dynamic reversibility. Dynamic exchange experiments involving small molecules and polymers provide substantial evidence supporting the dynamic exchange properties of selenoacetals. By utilizing this highly efficient click reaction, we successfully synthesized dynamic materials based on selenoacetal with remarkable reprocessing capabilities without any catalysts. These materials exhibit chemical recycling under alkaline conditions, wherein selenoacetal (SA) can decompose into active enone selenide (ES) and diselenides. Reintroducing selenol initiates a renewed reaction with the enone selenide, facilitating material recycling and yielding a newly developed dynamic material exhibiting both photo- and thermal responsiveness. The results underscore the potential of selenoacetal polymers in terms of recyclability and selective degradation, making them a valuable addition to conventional covalent adaptable networks."
38886767,Sources and applications of endothelial seed cells: a review.,"Endothelial cells (ECs) are widely used as donor cells in tissue engineering, organoid vascularization, and in vitro microvascular model development. ECs are invaluable tools for disease modeling and drug screening in fundamental research. When treating ischemic diseases, EC engraftment facilitates the restoration of damaged blood vessels, enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the current sources of ECs, which encompass stem/progenitor cells, primary ECs, cell lineage conversion, and ECs derived from other cellular sources, provides insights into their characteristics, potential applications, discusses challenges, and explores strategies to mitigate these issues. The primary aim is to serve as a reference for selecting suitable EC sources for preclinical research and promote the translation of basic research into clinical applications."
38886495,The relationship between prognosis and temporal muscle thickness in 102 patients with glioblastoma.,"Temporal muscle thickness measured on 3D MRI has recently been linked to prognosis in glioblastoma patients and may serve as an independent prognostic indicator. This single-center study looked at temporal muscle thickness and prognosis in patients with primary glioblastoma. Overall survival was the major study outcome. For a retrospective analysis from 2010 to 2020, clinical data from 102 patients with glioblastoma at the Department of Oncology Radiotherapy of the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University were gathered. Fifty-five cases from 2016 to 2020 contained glioblastoma molecular typing data, of which 45 were IDH wild-type glioblastomas and were analysed separately. TMT was measured on enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance images in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.Overall patient survival (OS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves were plotted using the log-rank-sum test to determine differences between groups, and multifactorial analyses were performed using a Cox proportional-risk model.The median TMT for 102 patients was 6.775 mm (range: 4.95-10.45 mm). Patients were grouped according to median TMT, and the median overall survival (23.0 months) was significantly longer in the TMT > median group than in the TMT median group (P 0.001; Log-rank test). Analysing 45 patients with IDH wild type alone, the median overall survival (12 months) of patients in the TMT > median group was significantly longer than that of patients in the TMT ≤ median group (8 months) (P < 0.001; Log-rank test).TMT can serve as an independent prognostic factor for glioblastoma."
38886030,Tetrazine cyclized peptides for one-bead-one-compound library: Synthesis and sequencing.,"While most FDA-approved peptide drugs are cyclic, robust cyclization chemistry of peptides and the deconvolution of the cyclic peptide sequences using tandem mass spectrometry render cyclic peptide drug discovery difficult. In this chapter, the protocol for the successful synthesis of tetrazine-linked cyclic peptide library in solid phase, which shows both robust cyclization and easy sequence deconvolution, is described. The protocol for the linearization and cleavage of cyclic peptides from the solid phase by simple UV light irradiation, followed by accurate sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry, is described. We describe the troubleshooting for this dithiol bis-arylation reaction and for the successful cleavage of the aryl cyclic peptide into linear form. This method for efficient solid-phase macrocyclization can be used for the rapid production of loop-based peptides and screening for inhibition of protein-protein interactions, by using the covalent inverse electron-demand Diels Alder reaction to supplement the non-covalent interaction between a protein and its peptide binder, isolating highly selective peptides in the process."
38886373,Longitudinally changed diet quality scores and their association with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases in the EPIC-Potsdam study.,"Association analyses between longitudinal changes in diet quality scores (DQIs) and cardiometabolic risk remain scarce. Hence, we aimed to investigate how changes in two DQIs are associated with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in the EPIC-Potsdam study. Changes in the Mediterranean Pyramid Score (MedPyr) and Healthy Diet Score (HDS) over 7 years from baseline (1994-1998) to follow-up 3 (2001-2005) were investigated in 23,548 middle-aged participants. Adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards Regression models were applied to investigate associations between changes in MedPyr and HDS and chronic disease incidence. More than 60% of the participants increased both DQIs more than 5%. Within a median follow-up time of 5 years 568 cases of T2D, 171 of MI, 189 of stroke were verified. An increased compared to stable MedPyr was associated with lower T2D risk (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.92), while a decreased MedPyr was associated with higher stroke risk (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.02-2.72). A decreased compared to stable HDS was associated with higher stroke risk (HR 1.80; 95% CI 1.02-3.20). The findings contribute further evidence on advantages of changing dietary intake towards a Mediterranean Diet. Although baseline HDS adherence was associated with T2D and stroke risk, longitudinal changes in HDS were only significantly associated with stroke risk."
38887708,Explainable artificial intelligence and microbiome data for food geographical origin: the Mozzarella di Bufala Campana PDO Case of Study.,"Identifying the origin of a food product holds paramount importance in ensuring food safety, quality, and authenticity. Knowing where a food item comes from provides crucial information about its production methods, handling practices, and potential exposure to contaminants. Machine learning techniques play a pivotal role in this process by enabling the analysis of complex data sets to uncover patterns and associations that can reveal the geographical source of a food item. This study aims to investigate the potential use of explainable artificial intelligence for identifying the food origin. The case of study of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana PDO has been considered by examining the composition of the microbiota in each samples. Three different supervised machine learning algorithms have been compared and the best classifier model is represented by Random Forest with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.93 and the top accuracy of 0.87. Machine learning models effectively classify origin, offering innovative ways to authenticate regional products and support local economies. Further research can explore microbiota analysis and extend applicability to diverse food products and contexts for enhanced accuracy and broader impact."
38887307,Squirrel bite-a rare cause of necrotizing soft tissue infection: Case report.,"Although squirrel bites are uncommon and generally benign, they have been implicated in the transmission of certain diseases in humans, some of which can be life-threatening. This report discusses the case of a 27-year-old hunter who developed a necrotizing soft tissue infection with vesiculo-bullous skin lesions after a ground squirrel bite."
38887755,Influence of Fe/Al oxyhydroxides and soil organic matter on the adsorption of Pb onto natural stream sediment.,"Adsorption of heavy metals on stream sediments has important implications for the fate and transport of contaminants in subsurface ecosystems. Lead (Pb) is a potentially hazardous heavy metal that is found in high amounts in anthropogenic environments, especially aquatic ecosystems. The key mechanisms for distributing this metal in the environment are adsorption and desorption in stream to sediment, and vice versa. Therefore, this work is mainly focused on the study of the influence of amorphous Fe/Al-oxyhydroxides and soil organic matter (SOM) on the adsorption of Pb onto natural stream sediment. Spiking adsorption experiments were carried out with four types of samples namely, untreated dried sediment, Fe/Al-oxyhydroxides depleted sediment, SOM depleted sediment and both Fe/Al as well as SOM depleted sediment in the pH range of 3.0 to 8.0. The results showed that Pb adsorption was reduced by up to 45% in amorphous Fe/Al-oxyhydroxide depleted sediment at pH 4.0 to 6.0, whereas a similar adsorption reduction was observed in SOM depleted sediment at pH 6.5 to 7.5. Maximum Pb adsorption was reduced by up to 75% in both amorphous Fe/Al-oxyhydroxides and SOM depleted sediment samples at pH ranges ranging from 3.0 to 7.0. Furthermore, it was shown that SOM was most significant at pH 6.5, while Fe/Al-oxyhydroxides were more important when pH was > 6.5 for the Pb adsorption in natural stream sediment."
38886896,Perceived overlap and therapy outcomes among couple clients.,"This article explores couples' perceptions and expectations of closeness in a clinical setting, and how relationship perceptions and expectations are associated with treatment outcomes. Bowen's theory of differentiation suggests that healthy relationships require a balance of autonomy and connection. However, some research suggests that contemporary societal expectations are pushing couples to expect greater degrees of closeness and less autonomy. Utilizing a clinical sample of 185 couples from an on-campus Couple and Family Therapy training clinic, this article explores couples' perceptions and expectations of relationship closeness utilizing graphics of overlapping circles. Latent profile analysis was conducted to identify three different profile groups based on perceptions and expectations. Wald tests for significant mean differences among the profiles were performed. Results identified significant differences between the three groups for satisfaction and separateness and connectedness variables, number of sessions and termination."
38887368,Modelling adult neurogenesis in the aging rodent hippocampus: a midlife crisis.,"Contrary to humans, adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents is not controversial. And in the last three decades, multiple studies in rodents have deemed adult neurogenesis essential for most hippocampal functions. The functional relevance of new neurons relies on their distinct physiological properties during their maturation before they become indistinguishable from mature granule cells. Most functional studies have used very young animals with robust neurogenesis. However, this trait declines dramatically with age, questioning its functional relevance in aging animals, a caveat that has been mentioned repeatedly, but rarely analyzed quantitatively. In this meta-analysis, we use data from published studies to determine the critical functional window of new neurons and to model their numbers across age in both mice and rats. Our model shows that new neurons with distinct functional profile represent about 3% of the total granule cells in young adult 3-month-old rodents, and their number decline following a power function to reach less than 1% in middle aged animals and less than 0.5% in old mice and rats. These low ratios pose an important logical and computational caveat to the proposed essential role of new neurons in the dentate gyrus, particularly in middle aged and old animals, a factor that needs to be adequately addressed when defining the relevance of adult neurogenesis in hippocampal function."
38887324,Secondary Hemorrhagic Shock Due to Spontaneous Isolated Dissection of the Superior Mesenteric Artery Branch.,"Spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA) is a rare condition, particularly when complicated by hemorrhagic shock. This case report describes the discovery of SIDSMA in an 88-year-old woman through CT angiography. The patient initially presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, which later progressed to hemorrhagic shock. After fluid resuscitation, the patient underwent successful endovascular treatment."
38887577,Domino reactions of chromones with activated carbonyl compounds.,"Domino reactions of chromones with activated carbonyl compounds, such as dimethyl acetone-1,3-dicarboxylate and 1,3-diphenylacetone, and with 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes, electroneutral equivalents of 1,3-dicarbonyl dianions, allow for a convenient synthesis of a great variety of products. The regioselectivity and course of the reaction depends of the substituent located at carbon C3 of the chromone moiety and also on the type of nucleophile employed."
38886290,Prediction of Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Immunotherapy Benefits Using Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning in Breast Cancer Pathology Images.,"The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). RNA sequencing of tumor tissue can offer valuable insights into TIME, but its high cost and long turnaround time seriously restrict its utility in routine clinical examinations. Several recent studies have suggested that ultrahigh-resolution pathology images can infer cellular and molecular characteristics. However, few study pay attention to the quantitative estimation of various tumor infiltration immune cells from pathology images. In this paper, we integrated contrastive learning and weakly supervised learning to infer tumor-associated macrophages and potential immunotherapy benefit from whole slide images (WSIs) of H &E stained pathological sections. We split the high-resolution WSIs into tiles and then apply contrastive learning to extract features of each tile. After aggregating the features at the tile level, we employ weak supervisory signals to fine-tune the encoder for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two independent breast cancer cohorts and spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate that the computational pathological features accurately predict the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, particularly the infiltration level of macrophages, as well as the immune subtypes and potential immunotherapy benefit. These findings demonstrate that our model effectively captures pathological features beyond human vision, establishing a mapping relationship between cellular compositions and histological morphology, thus expanding the clinical applications of digital pathology images."
38886008,Urban Stormwater Phosphorus Export Control: Comparing Traditional and Low-impact Development Best Management Practices.,"Data from the International Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP) Database were used to compare the phosphorus (P) control performance of six categories of stormwater BMPs representing traditional systems (stormwater pond, wetland basin, and detention basin) and low-impact development (LID) systems (bioretention cell, grass swale, and grass strip). Machine learning (ML) models were trained to predict the reduction or enrichment factors of surface runoff concentrations and loadings of total P (TP) and soluble reactive P (SRP) for the different categories of BMP systems. Relative to traditional BMPs, LIDs generally enriched TP and SRP concentrations in stormwater surface outflow and yielded poorer P runoff load control. The SRP concentration reduction and enrichment factors of LIDs also tended to be more sensitive to variations in climate and watershed characteristics. That is, LIDs were more likely to enrich surface runoff SRP concentrations in drier climates, when inflow SRP concentrations were low, and for watersheds exhibiting high impervious land cover. Overall, our results imply that stormwater BMPs do not universally attenuate urban P export and that preferentially implementing LIDs over traditional BMPs may increase TP and SRP export to receiving freshwater bodies, hence magnifying eutrophication risks."
38886260,Dimensions of Level-1 Group-Based Phylogenetic Networks.,"Phylogenetic networks represent evolutionary histories of sets of taxa where horizontal evolution or hybridization has occurred. Placing a Markov model of evolution on a phylogenetic network gives a model that is particularly amenable to algebraic study by representing it as an algebraic variety. In this paper, we give a formula for the dimension of the variety corresponding to a triangle-free level-1 phylogenetic network under a group-based evolutionary model. On our way to this, we give a dimension formula for codimension zero toric fiber products. We conclude by illustrating applications to identifiability."

38887895,Digest: Are female miniature geckos larger than males?,"What shapes the differences in body size between males and females in miniature species? One potential key factor is reproduction, which could constrain body size evolution because females of miniature species need to remain large enough to lay viable eggs. Glynne & Adams (2024) tested this hypothesis in two gecko families, the Sphaerodactylidae and Phyllodactylidae. Their findings support this hypothesis, indicating that female-biased size differences in miniature species are shaped by selection for reproductive success."
38887425,"Medical Nutrition Education for Health, Not Harm: BMI, Weight Stigma, Eating Disorders, and Social Determinants of Health.","Effective nutrition training is fundamental to medical education. Current training is inadequate and can cause harm to students and patients alike; it leaves physicians unprepared to counsel on nutrition, places undue focus on weight and body mass index (BMI), can exacerbate anti-obesity bias, and increase risk for development of eating disorders, while neglecting social determinants of health and communication skills. Physicians and educators hold positions of influence in society; what we say and how we say it matters. We propose actionable approaches to improve nutrition education to minimize harm and pursue evidence-based, effective, and equitable healthcare."
38887334,Cryobiopsy for Secondary Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis.,"Secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (SPAP) is one of the diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, and the utility and safety of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) for diagnosing SPAP are unknown. A case of SPAP diagnosed by TBLC is presented. Specimens that were useful for diagnosis were collected, and there was no adverse event following TBLC. The usefulness of TBLC for interstitial lung disease has been widely reported, but there are few reports of SPAP. We present the clinical course of TBLC in the diagnosis of SPAP."
38886523,Overriding Mendelian inheritance in Arabidopsis with a CRISPR toxin-antidote gene drive that impairs pollen germination.,"Synthetic gene drives, inspired by natural selfish genetic elements and transmitted to progeny at super-Mendelian (>50%) frequencies, present transformative potential for disseminating traits that benefit humans throughout wild populations, even facing potential fitness costs. Here we constructed a gene drive system in plants called CRISPR-Assisted Inheritance utilizing NPG1 (CAIN), which uses a toxin-antidote mechanism in the male germline to override Mendelian inheritance. Specifically, a guide RNA-Cas9 cassette targets the essential No Pollen Germination 1 (NPG1) gene, serving as the toxin to block pollen germination. A recoded, CRISPR-resistant copy of NPG1 serves as the antidote, providing rescue only in pollen cells that carry the drive. To limit potential consequences of inadvertent release, we used self-pollinating Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. The drive demonstrated a robust 88-99% transmission rate over two successive generations, producing minimal resistance alleles that are unlikely to inhibit drive spread. Our study provides a strong basis for rapid genetic modification or suppression of outcrossing plant populations."
38885957,"SARS-CoV-2 incidence, seroprevalence, and antibody dynamics in a rural, population-based cohort: March 2020 - July 2022.","Studies of SARS-CoV-2 incidence are important for response to continued transmission and future pandemics. We followed a rural community cohort with broad age representation with active surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 identification from November 2020 through July 2022. Participants provided serum specimens at regular intervals and following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We estimated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by study RT-PCR, electronic health record documentation or self-report of a positive test, or serology. We also estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antibodies measured by ELISA. Overall, 65% of the cohort had ≥1 SARS-CoV-2 infection by July 2022, and 19% of those with primary infection were reinfected. Infection and vaccination contributed to high seroprevalence, 98% (95% CI: 95%, 99%) of participants were spike or nucleocapsid seropositive at the end of follow-up. Among those seropositive, 82% were vaccinated. Participants were more likely to be seropositive to spike than nucleocapsid following infection. Infection among seropositive individuals could be identified by increases in nucleocapsid, but not spike, ELISA optical density values. Nucleocapsid antibodies waned more quickly after infection than spike antibodies. High levels of SARS-CoV-2 population immunity, as found in this study, are leading to changing epidemiology necessitating ongoing surveillance and policy evaluation."
38886958,"Inhibiting SHP2 reduces glycolysis, promotes microglial M1 polarization, and alleviates secondary inflammation following spinal cord injury in a mouse model.","JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202503000-00030/figure1/v/2024-06-17T092413Z/r/image-tiff Reducing the secondary inflammatory response, which is partly mediated by microglia, is a key focus in the treatment of spinal cord injury. Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by PTPN11, is widely expressed in the human body and plays a role in inflammation through various mechanisms. Therefore, SHP2 is considered a potential target for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. However, its role in secondary inflammation after spinal cord injury remains unclear. In this study, SHP2 was found to be abundantly expressed in microglia at the site of spinal cord injury. Inhibition of SHP2 expression using siRNA and SHP2 inhibitors attenuated the microglial inflammatory response in an in vitro lipopolysaccharide-induced model of inflammation. Notably, after treatment with SHP2 inhibitors, mice with spinal cord injury exhibited significantly improved hind limb locomotor function and reduced residual urine volume in the bladder. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that, in microglia stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, inhibiting SHP2 expression promoted M2 polarization and inhibited M1 polarization. Finally, a co-culture experiment was conducted to assess the effect of microglia treated with SHP2 inhibitors on neuronal cells. The results demonstrated that inflammatory factors produced by microglia promoted neuronal apoptosis, while inhibiting SHP2 expression mitigated these effects. Collectively, our findings suggest that SHP2 enhances secondary inflammation and neuronal damage subsequent to spinal cord injury by modulating microglial phenotype. Therefore, inhibiting SHP2 alleviates the inflammatory response in mice with spinal cord injury and promotes functional recovery postinjury."
38885910,Development and characterization of ferulic acid-loaded chitosan nanoparticle embedded- hydrogel for diabetic wound delivery.,"Diabetic wounds present a significant global health challenge exacerbated by chronic hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, impeding the natural healing process. Despite various treatment strategies, diabetic foot ulceration lacks standardized therapy. Ferulic acid (FA), known for its potent antidiabetic and antioxidant properties, holds promise for diabetic wound management. However, oral administration of FA faces limitations due to rapid oxidation, stability issues, and low bioavailability. The topical application of FA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (FA-CSNPs) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome these challenges. Here, we report the development of a sustained-release formulation of FA-CSNPs within a hydrogel matrix composed of Chitosan and gelatin. The FA-CSNPs were synthesized using the ionic gelation method andoptimized through a Central Composite Design (CCD) approach. Characterization of the optimized nanoparticles revealed spherical morphology, a particle size of 56.9 ± 2.5 nm, and an impressive entrapment efficiency of 90.3 ± 2.4 %. Subsequently, an FA-CSNPs-loaded hydrogel was formulated, incorporating chitosan as a gelling agent, gelatin to enhance mechanical properties and cell permeation, and glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker. Comprehensive characterization of the hydrogel included pH, moisture loss, porosity, swelling index, rheology, water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), SEM, TEM, invitro drug release studies, antioxidant activity, antibacterial efficacy, cell cytotoxicity, cell migration studies on L929 fibroblast cell line, and stability studies. The stability study demonstrated negligible variations in particle size, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency over 60 days, ensuring the stable nature of nanoparticles and hydrogel. This innovative delivery approach embedded within a hydrogel matrix holds significant promise for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of FA-CSNPs-hydrogel in diabetic wound healing applications."
38886806,Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy.,"The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, encompassing development, tissue homeostasis, and cell proliferation. Under normal physiological conditions, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is meticulously regulated. However, aberrant activation of this pathway and downstream target genes can occur due to mutations in key components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, epigenetic modifications, and crosstalk with other signaling pathways. Consequently, these dysregulations contribute significantly to tumor initiation and progression. Therapies targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling transduction have exhibited promising prospects and potential for tumor treatment. An increasing number of medications targeting this pathway are continuously being developed and validated. This comprehensive review aims to summarize the latest advances in our understanding of the role played by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in carcinogenesis and targeted therapy, providing valuable insights into acknowledging current opportunities and challenges associated with targeting this signaling pathway in cancer research and treatment."
38886581,Latrophilin-2 mediates fluid shear stress mechanotransduction at endothelial junctions.,"Endothelial cell responses to fluid shear stress from blood flow are crucial for vascular development, function, and disease. A complex of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), and Plexin D1 located at cell-cell junctions mediates many of these events. However, available evidence suggests that another mechanosensor upstream of PECAM-1 initiates signaling. Hypothesizing that GPCR and Gα proteins may serve this role, we performed siRNA screening of Gα subunits and found that Gαi2 and Gαq/11 are required for activation of the junctional complex. We then developed a new activation assay, which showed that these G proteins are activated by flow. We next mapped the Gα residues required for activation and developed an affinity purification method that used this information to identify latrophilin-2 (Lphn2/ADGRL2) as the upstream GPCR. Latrophilin-2 is required for all PECAM-1 downstream events tested. In both mice and zebrafish, latrophilin-2 is required for flow-dependent angiogenesis and artery remodeling. Furthermore, endothelial-specific knockout demonstrates that latrophilin plays a role in flow-dependent artery remodeling. Human genetic data reveal a correlation between the latrophilin-2-encoding Adgrl2 gene and cardiovascular disease. Together, these results define a pathway that connects latrophilin-dependent G protein activation to subsequent endothelial signaling, vascular physiology, and disease."
38887478,Combination Antifungal Therapy for Invasive Mucormycosis in Immunocompromised Hosts: A Single-Center Experience.,"Combination antifungal therapy for invasive mucormycosis remains controversial and is inconsistently defined in prior studies. In a cohort of patients with immunocompromised status and invasive mucormycosis, we found no difference in 6-week mortality with up-front or salvage combination therapy as compared with monotherapy."
38886378,Progressive senescence programs induce intrinsic vulnerability to aging-related female breast cancer.,"Cancer incidence escalates exponentially with advancing age; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we build a chronological molecular clock at single-cell transcription level with a mammary stem cell-enriched population to depict physiological aging dynamics in female mice. We find that the mammary aging process is asynchronous and progressive, initiated by an early senescence program, succeeded by an entropic late senescence program with elevated cancer associated pathways, vulnerable to cancer predisposition. The transition towards senescence program is governed by a stem cell factor Bcl11b, loss of which accelerates mammary ageing with enhanced DMBA-induced tumor formation. We have identified a drug TPCA-1 that can rejuvenate mammary cells and significantly reduce aging-related cancer incidence. Our findings establish a molecular portrait of progressive mammary cell aging and elucidate the transcriptional regulatory network bridging mammary aging and cancer predisposition, which has potential implications for the management of cancer prevalence in the aged."
38887511,Genetic Diversity Based on Human Y Chromosome Analysis: A Bibliometric Review Between 2014 and 2023.,"The Y chromosome has gained significant importance in the examination of genetic studies of populations because of its non-recombinant character and its form of uniparental inheritance. This work seeks to offer a comprehensive review of the specialty literature in the field of population genetics, focusing specifically on the analysis of the human Y chromosome using a bibliometric approach and knowledge mapping. This involves establishing worldwide structural networks by identifying the primary research themes, authors, and papers that have had a significant impact on the academic community. The objective is to examine global publications by analyzing citations at both the document and country level. This will involve conducting co-citation analysis for references with a high number of citations, examining bibliographic coupling through journal analysis, analyzing the co-occurrence of keywords, and investigating collaboration between authors from a country perspective. The research papers have been extracted from the Web of Science database. The bibliometric analysis was performed using the Bibliometrix and VOSviewer software tools. The purpose of this article is to serve as a starting point for future research dedicated to the analysis of the diversity of human Y chromosome haplotypes. The objectives of the study were to identify and present the most cited publications and references with the highest number of citations, and to highlight current publications at the national level."
38886109,Radiation Maculopathy in Patients with Malignant Melanoma of the Corpus Ciliare and Choroidea Following One-Day Session of Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"The aim of the thesis is to present the case of a patient in whom bilateral calcification of the hydrophilic intraocular lens (IOL) Lentis M+ LS-313 MF30 (Oculentis) has developed. Due to the negative effect on visual functions, explantation and replacement of the artificial lens was necessary in both eyes. Case Report: An overview of the available literature summarized the diagnostics, current examination methods and possibilities of the surgical solution of calcification of the bifocal hydrophilic lens Lentis M+ LS-313 MF30 (Oculentis). The specific solution is described in a case report of a patient in whom calcification of both lenses developed 6 years after implantation of the IOL. In 2015, the patient underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery of both eyes with the implantation of an artificial intraocular lens into the capsule. In September 2021, an 82-year-old man was examined at our outpatient clinic for deterioration of visual acuity and changes in the material of the artificial IOL which were perceptible during a clinical examination, on the recommendation of a local ophthalmologist. Blurred vision predominated. A diagnosis of intraocular lens opacification was confirmed and documented using a Scheimpflug camera (OCULUS Pentacam HR) and anterior OCT (Avanti RTVue XR Optovue,). The patient was indicated for explantation and replacement of the opacified intraocular lens in the left and subsequently in the right eye- The same type of IOL was used for reimplantation with good functional results. Conclusion: Since 2010, multifocal lens implantation has been on an upward trend worldwide. This type of MF IOL has also been used in thousands of implantations. A number of other explantations can be expected in the coming years. The optimal solution is the correct replacement of the calcified IOL with the same construction made of safer hydrophobic material."
38887548,A scoping review of the effects of mushroom and fungus extracts in rodent models of depression and tests of antidepressant activity.,"One of the most important developments in psychopharmacology in the past decade has been the emergence of novel treatments for mood disorders, such as psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Psilocybin is most commonly found in different species of mushroom; however, the literature on mushroom and fungus extracts with potential antidepressant activity extends well beyond just psilocybin-containing mushrooms, and includes both psychedelic and non-psychedelic species. In the current review, we systematically review the preclinical literature on mushroom and fungus extracts, and their effects of animal models of depression and tests of antidepressant activity. The PICO structure, PRISMA checklist and the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews of intervention were used to guide the search strategy. A scoping search was conducted in electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and Web of Science. The literature search identified 50 relevant and suitable published studies. These included 19 different species of mushrooms, as well as seven different species of other fungi. Nearly all studies reported antidepressant-like effects of treatment with extracts. Treatments were most commonly delivered orally, in both acute and chronically administered studies to predominantly male rodents. Multiple animal models of depression were used, the most common being unpredictable chronic mild stress, while the tail suspension test and forced swim test were most frequently used as standalone antidepressant screens. Details on each experiment with mushroom and fungus species are discussed in detail, while an evaluation is provided of the strengths and weaknesses of these studies."
38886380,Chromosome-level genome assembly of the cereal cyst nematode Heterodera flipjevi.,"As an economically important plant parasitic nematode (PPN), Heterodera filipjevi causes great damage on wheat, and now it was widely recorded in many countries. While multiple genomes of PPNs have been published, high-quality genome assembly and annotation on H. filipjevi have yet to be performed. This study presents a chromosome-scale genome assembly and annotation for H. filipjevi, utilizing a combination of Illumina short-read, PacBio long-read, and Hi-C sequencing technologies. The genome consists of 9 pseudo-chromosomes that contain 134.19 Mb of sequence, with a scaffold N50 length of 11.88 Mb. In total, 10,036 genes were annotated, representing 75.20% of the total predicted protein-coding genes. Our study provides the first chromosome-scale genome for H. filipjevi, which is also the inaugural high-quality genome of cereal cyst nematodes (CCNs). It provides a valuable genomic resource for further biological research and pest management of cereal cyst nematodes disease."
38886452,Advanced optical assessment and modeling of extrusion bioprinting.,"In the context of tissue engineering, biofabrication techniques are employed to process cells in hydrogel-based matrices, known as bioinks, into complex 3D structures. The aim is the production of functional tissue models or even entire organs. The regenerative production of biological tissues adheres to a multitude of criteria that ultimately determine the maturation of a functional tissue. These criteria are of biological nature, such as the biomimetic spatial positioning of different cell types within a physiologically and mechanically suitable matrix, which enables tissue maturation. Furthermore, the processing, a combination of technical procedures and biological materials, has proven highly challenging since cells are sensitive to stress, for example from shear and tensile forces, which may affect their vitality. On the other hand, high resolutions are pursued to create optimal conditions for subsequent tissue maturation. From an analytical perspective, it is prudent to first investigate the printing behavior of bioinks before undertaking complex biological tests. According to our findings, conventional shear rheological tests are insufficient to fully characterize the printing behavior of a bioink. For this reason, we have developed optical methods that, complementarily to the already developed tests, allow for quantification of printing quality and further viscoelastic modeling of bioinks."
38885817,Role of miRNAs in assisted reproductive technology.,"Cellular proteins and the mRNAs that encode them are key factors in oocyte and sperm development, and the mechanisms that regulate their translation and degradation play an important role during early embryogenesis. There is abundant evidence that expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is crucial for embryo development and are highly involved in regulating translation during oocyte and early embryo development. MiRNAs are a group of short (18-24 nucleotides) non-coding RNA molecules that regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing. The miRNAs are secreted outside the cell by embryos during preimplantation embryo development. Understanding regulatory mechanisms involving miRNAs during gametogenesis and embryogenesis will provide insights into molecular pathways active during gamete formation and early embryo development. This review summarizes recent findings regarding multiple roles of miRNAs in molecular signaling, plus their transport during gametogenesis and embryo preimplantation."
38886347,HER2-targeting antibody drug conjugate FS-1502 in HER2-expressing metastatic breast cancer: a phase 1a/1b trial.,"Currently approved HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) are associated with safety concerns. In this multicenter, single-arm, dose-escalation (phase 1a) and dose-expansion (phase 1b) phase 1 trial (NCT03944499), patients with HER2-expressing advanced solid tumors received FS-1502 (an anti-HER2 ADC) with a 3 + 3 design in phase 1a; patients with metastatic HER2-positive BC received FS-1502 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in phase 1b. The primary end points were dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D for phase 1a and objective response rate (ORR) for phase 1b. A total of 150 patients with HER2-expressing solid tumors (n = 5) and BC (n = 145) were enrolled (female, n = 146, 97.3%). One DLT each was reported at 3.0 and 3.5 mg/kg; the MTD was not reached. The RP2D was 2.3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. Five (3.3%) patients experienced pneumonitis; four (2.7%) had grade 3 reversible ocular events. Of 67 HER2-positive BC patients receiving the RP2D, the best ORR was 53.7% (95% CI, 41.1-66.0%), including PRs confirmed (confirmed ORR, 37.5%) and pending for confirmation. FS-1502 was well tolerated with limited ocular and pulmonary findings and demonstrated promising antitumor activity in HER2-positive BC patients."
38885893,Age differences in the principal temporo-spatial components of EEG activity during a proactive interference task.,"Proactive interference (PI) is the disruptive effect of no longer relevant information on current working memory (WM) processing. PI effects in EEG data have been previously found to be altered in healthy aging, although it remains unclear the extent to which such changes reflect delayed or different brain mechanisms employed to overcome PI. Hence, we had twenty-six young (18-34 years) and sixteen old (53-68 years) healthy adults complete a Recent Probes task while EEG was recorded. Compared to young adults, old adults were slower, less accurate and less able to discriminate when they last saw a given stimulus, but PI effects on reaction time were greater in the former, likely due to a general difficulty that old adults had in the task. Temporo-spatial principal component analysis of the EEG data showed young and older adults to differ in terms of temporal and spatial characteristics of brain activity associated with resolving PI. YA showed a factor indicative of a medial frontal negativity (MFN) that showed greater amplitude in low compared to high PI trials. OA, in contrast, showed a late positive component (LPC), although similarly with larger amplitude in low compared to high PI trials. The modulation of the MFN component in YA may reflect the recruitment of cognitive control to overcome PI. The modulation of the LPC in OA may represent the detection of conflict between familiarity and context recollection during PI."
38886883,Unmet Questions About Frailty in Kidney Transplant Candidates.,"Frailty occurs frequently among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, especially among women. Assessing frailty in kidney transplant (KT) candidates is crucial for informing them about associated risks. However, there is poor agreement between frailty scales and research on their correlation with transplant outcomes. Being prefrail significantly impacts both graft and patient survival, often beginning with just 1 Fried criterion. Rather than viewing frailty as a categorical state, it should be regarded as a spectrum ranging from 1 to 5 criteria, with the risk of adverse outcomes escalating as frailty worsens. Frailty status fluctuates during the waiting period for KT; hence, a 1-time frailty evaluation is insufficient to determine risks and implement strategies for improving functional status. Further research should investigate the components of frailty that most frequently change during this waiting period and establish strategies to prevent or reverse frailty. Although careful evaluation of frail KT candidates is necessary to prevent early complications and mortality, exclusion based solely on a frailty score is unwarranted. Instead, efforts should focus on timely interventions to enhance their condition before transplantation. Although evidence is limited, exercise programs appear feasible and yield positive results. A pretransplant clinical framework encompassing multimodal prehabilitation-comprising physical therapy, nutritional measures, and psychological support-during the waiting list period may help alleviate the effects of frailty and poor fitness after KT, ultimately improving key outcomes. Despite logistical challenges, there is a pressing need for interventional trials in this area."
38887031,Short-term Heat Application Reduces Itch Intensity in Atopic Dermatitis: Insights from Mechanical Induction and Real-life Episodes.,"Heat application is known to activate transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, which play a crucial role in sensory perception, including itch. In this study, the effect of a 5-s, 49°C heat application on itch intensity in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients was evaluated. The study comprised 2 parts: a controlled trial investigating the impact of brief heat treatment on mechanically induced itch, and a real-life study of AD patients experiencing itch attacks. A significant and immediate reduction in itch sensations following heat application was shown, with effects enduring over time. This response, however, showed notable individual variability, underscoring the potential of personalized approaches in AD treatment. Repeated applications of heat showed no habituation effect, suggesting its viability as a non-pharmacological, patient-tailored option for managing itch in AD. Further research in larger cohorts is warranted to refine treatment protocols and deepen understanding of the mechanisms involved."
38886112,Diet predisposes to pancreatic cancer through cellular nutrient sensing pathways.,"Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease with limited effective treatments. A deeper understanding of its molecular mechanisms is crucial to reduce incidence and mortality. Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between diet and disease risk, though dietary recommendations for at-risk individuals remain debated. Here, we propose that cell-intrinsic nutrient sensing pathways respond to specific diet-derived cues to facilitate oncogenic transformation of pancreatic epithelial cells. This review explores how diet influences pancreatic cancer predisposition through nutrient sensing and downstream consequences for (pre-)cancer cell biology. We also examine experimental evidence connecting specific food intake to pancreatic cancer progression, highlighting nutrient sensing as a promising target for therapeutic development to mitigate disease risk."
38885881,Probing neuronal activity with genetically encoded calcium and voltage fluorescent indicators.,"Monitoring neural activity in individual neurons is crucial for understanding neural circuits and brain functions. The emergence of optical imaging technologies has dramatically transformed the field of neuroscience, enabling detailed observation of large-scale neuronal populations with both cellular and subcellular resolution. This transformation will be further accelerated by the integration of these imaging technologies and advanced big data analysis. Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators to detect neural activity with high signal-to-noise ratios are pivotal in this advancement. In recent years, these indicators have undergone significant developments, greatly enhancing the understanding of neural dynamics and networks. This review highlights the recent progress in genetically encoded calcium and voltage indicators and discusses the future direction of imaging techniques with big data analysis that deepens our understanding of the complexities of the brain."
38886149,Progress on the role of LIN28A/B in tumor development and progression.,"LIN28A and its homolog LIN28B are highly conserved RNA-binding proteins that play important roles in early embryonic development, somatic cell reprogramming, metabolism and tumorigenesis. LIN28A/B are highly expressed in a variety of malignant tumors such as breast cancer. They play important roles in the initiation, maintenance, and metastasis of tumors and are associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown that the main regulatory mechanisms of LIN28A/B include let-7s dependent ways and let-7s independent ways, such as directly targeting mRNA. In this review, we summarize the function and molecular regulatory mechanisms of LIN28A/B in malignant tumors such as liver cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer, in order to provide references for further exploring the function and mechanism of LIN28A/B and their possible roles in clinical applications."
38887306,Myroids odoratum bacteremia: A rare clinical isolate presented as a soft tissue infection.,"Myroides odoratus infection, a rare gram-negative bacillus, predominantly affects immunocompromised patients and presents with diverse clinical manifestations. Antibiotic resistance poses challenges in determining appropriate treatment. This case underscores successful management of Myroides odoratus cellulitis complicated by bacteremia with dual antibiotic therapy, emphasizing the importance of timely recognition and susceptibility testing for effective treatment strategies."
38887741,Association of mildly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance with major cardiovascular events in pulmonary hypertension and chronic kidney disease: A retrospective cohort analysis.,Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Our study suggests mildly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance ( > 2 to ≤ 3) is independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events at 1-year follow-up. Early diagnosis of precapillary PH in CKD patients can potentially improve clinical outcomes.
38887165,Gut-liver axis: Potential mechanisms of action of food-derived extracellular vesicles.,"Food-derived extracellular vesicles (FEVs) are nanoscale membrane vesicles obtained from dietary materials such as breast milk, plants and probiotics. Distinct from other EVs, FEVs can survive the harsh degrading conditions in the gastrointestinal tract and reach the intestines. This unique feature allows FEVs to be promising prebiotics in health and oral nanomedicine for gut disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Interestingly, therapeutic effects of FEVs have recently also been observed in non-gastrointestinal diseases. However, the mechanisms remain unclear or even mysterious. It is speculated that orally administered FEVs could enter the bloodstream, reach remote organs, and thus exert therapeutic effects therein. However, emerging evidence suggests that the amount of FEVs reaching organs beyond the gastrointestinal tract is marginal and may be insufficient to account for the significant therapeutic effects achieved regarding diseases involving remote organs such as the liver. Thus, we herein propose that FEVs primarily act locally in the intestine by modulating intestinal microenvironments such as barrier integrity and microbiota, thereby eliciting therapeutic impact remotely on the liver in non-gastrointestinal diseases via the gut-liver axis. Likewise, drugs delivered to the gastrointestinal system through FEVs may act via the gut-liver axis. As the liver is the main metabolic hub, the intestinal microenvironment may be implicated in other metabolic diseases. In fact, many patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease suffer from a leaky gut and dysbiosis. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent progress in FEVs and discuss their biomedical applications as therapeutic agents and drug delivery systems, highlighting the pivotal role of the gut-liver axis in the mechanisms of action of FEVs for the treatment of gut disorders and metabolic diseases."
38887995,Diving into freshwater microbial metabolites: Pioneering research and future prospects.,"In practically every facet of life, especially nutrition, agriculture, and healthcare, microorganisms offer a prospective origin for abundant natural substances and products. Among these microorganisms, bacteria also possess the capability to rapidly acclimate to diverse environments, utilize varied resources, and effectively respond to environmental fluctuations, including those influenced by human activities like pollution and climate change. The ever-changing environment of freshwater bodies influences bacterial communities, offering opportunities for improving health and environmental conservation that remain unexplored. Herein, the study discusses the bacterial taxa along with specialised metabolites with antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer activity that have been identified from freshwater environments, thus achieving Sustainable Development Goals addressing health and wellbeing (SDG-3), economic growth (SDG-8) along with industrial development (SDG-9). The present review is intended as a compendium for research teams working in the fields of medicinal chemistry, organic chemistry, clinical research, and natural product chemistry."
38887279,The role of HOTAIR in the modulation of resistance to anticancer therapy.,"Leading anti-tumour therapeutic strategies typically involve surgery and radiotherapy for locally advanced (non-metastatic) cancers, while hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and molecular targeted therapy are the current treatment options for metastatic cancer. Despite the initially high sensitivity rate to anticancer therapies, a large number of patients develop resistance, leading to a poor prognosis. The mechanisms related to drug resistance are highly complex, and long non-coding RNAs appear to play a crucial role in these processes. Among these, the lncRNA homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), widely implicated in cancer initiation and progression, likewise plays a significant role in anticancer drug resistance. It can modulate cell activities such as proliferation, apoptosis, hypoxia, autophagy, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby contributing to the development of resistant tumour cells. In this manuscript, we describe different mechanisms of antitumor drug resistance in which HOTAIR is involved and suggest its potential as a therapeutic predictive biomarker for the management of cancer patients."
38885878,FRACTURES OF THE PERONEAL MALLEOLUS: CURRENT CONCEPTS.,"Ankle fractures represent up to 9% of all fractures, with an increased incidence in the elderly population. Among these fractures, isolated fractures of the lateral malleolus are the most common, representing 65-70% of all cases. The therapeutic decision-making primarily relies on the stability of the ankle ring, considering it stable if affected at one point and unstable if two or more points are affected. Surgical treatment focuses on restoring the length of the fibula, joint reconstruction, stabilizing the syndesmosis, and providing a stable fixation. It is crucial to rule out associated injuries that may influence therapeutic management. This article reviews the evaluation and management of lateral malleolus fractures, proposes a decision-making algorithm, and examines several fibular fixation options."
38888012,The emerging role of mtDNA release in sepsis: Current evidence and potential therapeutic targets.,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory reaction caused by infection, and severe sepsis can develop into septic shock, eventually leading to multiorgan dysfunction and even death. In recent years, studies have shown that mitochondrial damage is closely related to the occurrence and development of sepsis. Recent years have seen a surge in concern over mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as anomalies in this material can lead to cellular dysfunction, disruption of aerobic respiration, and even death of the cell. In this review, we discuss the latest findings on the mechanisms of mitochondrial damage and the molecular mechanisms controlling mitochondrial mtDNA release. We also explored the connection between mtDNA misplacement and inflammatory activation. Additionally, we propose potential therapeutic targets of mtDNA for sepsis treatment."
38885831,"Re: Re: Laboratory safety evaluation of bedinvetmab, a canine anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody, in dogs.","In their letter to the editor, Farrell et al., 2024 presented questions related to canine joint health after treatment with the anti-Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) monoclonal antibody (mAb) bedinvetmab, which was presented as a component of a non-clinical laboratory safety assessment published in Krautmann, et al. 2021. Their questions appear to have stemmed from an anti-NGF mAb developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis in humans (tanezumab; FDA, 2021) which in 2021 failed to achieve marketing approval due to an unfavorable benefit: risk profile, primarily due to a syndrome called Rapidly Progressive Osteoarthritis (RPOA) which occurred more commonly in treatment groups when compared to controls. Farrell et. al. 2024 have posed questions on radiographic and histopathologic bone findings from studies included in Krautmann, et al., 2021 and communicated in the FDA's Freedom of Information summary for Librela (FDA, 2023). These findings have previously been determined to be incidental and not bedinvetmab-associated. To address the questions posed, it is important to briefly define RPOA and summarize the syndrome in humans, review why the bone/joint findings in bedinvetmab safety studies in dogs are not indicative of RPOA or an RPOA-like condition, provide an update on joint health after use of bedinvetmab since market approval (>3 years in some markets), and summarize why Zoetis, the manufacturer of Librela, has confidence in joint safety after use of bedinvetmab in dogs."
38887277,Mining Bovine Milk Proteins for DPP-4 Inhibitory Peptides Using Machine Learning and Virtual Proteolysis.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) enzyme inhibitors are a promising category of diabetes medications. Bioactive peptides, particularly those derived from bovine milk proteins, play crucial roles in inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme. This study describes a comprehensive strategy for DPP-4 inhibitory peptide discovery and validation that combines machine learning and virtual proteolysis techniques. Five machine learning models, including GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and RF, were trained. Notably, LightGBM demonstrated superior performance with an AUC value of 0.92 ± 0.01. Subsequently, LightGBM was employed to forecast the DPP-4 inhibitory potential of peptides generated through virtual proteolysis of milk proteins. Through a series of in silico screening process and in vitro experiments, GPVRGPF and HPHPHL were found to exhibit good DPP-4 inhibitory activity. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the inhibitory mechanisms of these peptides. Through retracing the virtual proteolysis steps, it was found that GPVRGPF can be obtained from β-casein through enzymatic hydrolysis by chymotrypsin, while HPHPHL can be obtained from κ-casein through enzymatic hydrolysis by stem bromelain or papain. In summary, the integration of machine learning and virtual proteolysis techniques can aid in the preliminary determination of key hydrolysis parameters and facilitate the efficient screening of bioactive peptides."
38887754,"Mental Health Service Users and Their Caregivers Perspectives on Personal Recovery from Severe Mental Health Conditions in Cape Town, South Africa: A Qualitative Study.","Severe mental health conditions (SMHCs) significantly contribute to the global disease burden. In low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) like South Africa, the long-term impact of SMHCs on individuals and their families is serious. However, mental health services focus on clinical recovery, with little attention given to the personal recovery needs of mental health service users (MHSUs) and their caregivers. The CHIME framework outlines five domains characterising personal recovery: connectedness, hope and optimism about the future, identity, meaning in life, and empowerment. This qualitative, descriptive study sought insights from male MHSUs and their caregivers on their perspectives of personal recovery from SMHCs. Four male MHSUs and three of their caregivers were purposively selected from Cape Flats communities in the Western Cape. Data were collected using visual participatory methods, including photovoice, life graphs, community maps, and photo-elicitation interviews with MHSUs. In addition, semi-structured interviews were held with caregivers. Data were thematically analysed, and two main themes emerged: Finding meaningful participation and affirming agency. These themes describe how diverse contextual, socioeconomic, political, demographic, cultural, and spiritual factors help and hinder personal recovery. MHSUs and their caregivers sought support from mental health non-profit organisations (MH-NPOs) because of stigmatising attitudes from their communities. MH-NPOs provided MHSUs with long-term relational support and opportunities to build their capacities which helped them access living, learning, working and socialising opportunities. Understanding the diverse needs of MHSUs and including MH-NPOs in scaling up community-based mental health services in LMICs will enable more accessible services that support personal recovery."
38886586,Interaction between MED12 and ΔNp63 activates basal identity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"The presence of basal lineage characteristics signifies hyperaggressive human adenocarcinomas of the breast, bladder and pancreas. However, the biochemical mechanisms that maintain this aberrant cell state are poorly understood. Here we performed marker-based genetic screens in search of factors needed to maintain basal identity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This approach revealed MED12 as a powerful regulator of the basal cell state in this disease. Using biochemical reconstitution and epigenomics, we show that MED12 carries out this function by bridging the transcription factor ΔNp63, a known master regulator of the basal lineage, with the Mediator complex to activate lineage-specific enhancer elements. Consistent with this finding, the growth of basal-like PDAC is hypersensitive to MED12 loss when compared to PDAC cells lacking basal characteristics. Taken together, our genetic screens have revealed a biochemical interaction that sustains basal identity in human cancer, which could serve as a target for tumor lineage-directed therapeutics."
38885943,"FDA's stamp of approval: Unveiling peptide breakthroughs in cardiovascular diseases, ACE, HIV, CNS, and beyond.","Peptides exhibit significant specificity and effective interaction with therapeutic targets, positioning themselves as key players in the global pharmaceutical market. They offer potential treatments for a wide range of diseases, including those that pose significant challenges. Notably, the peptide trofinetide (Daybue) marked a groundbreaking achievement by providing the first-ever cure for Rett syndrome, and several peptides have secured FDA approval as first-in-class medications. Furthermore, peptides are expanding their presence in areas traditionally dominated by either small or large molecules. A noteworthy example is the FDA approval of motixafortide (Aphexda) as the first peptide-based chemokine antagonist. Here, the focus will be on the analysis of FDA-approved peptides, particularly those targeting cardiovascular diseases, human immunodeficiency, central nervous system diseases, and various other intriguing classes addressing conditions such as osteoporosis, thrombocytopenia, Cushing's disease, and hypoglycemia, among others. The review will explore the chemical structures of the peptides, their indications and modes of action, the developmental trajectory, and potential adverse effects."

The two biggest barriers to the uptake of robotic hepatectomy are the high cost and instrument limitations. Transection of the liver parenchyma is the main issue in robotic hepatectomy. Nonetheless, with adequate experience and the aid of reliable and enhanced three-dimensional visualization, many robotic surgeons have successfully used robotic Harmonic ACE curved shears (Intuitive Surgical Inc.) for parenchymal transection of the liver. Herein, we share a method of using robotic Harmonic ACE curved shears for parenchymal transection using a video clip."

38887820,Clustering-resistant Cu Single Atoms on Porous Au Nanoparticles Supported by TiO2 for Sustainable Photoconversion of CO2 into CH4.,"Photocatalysts based on single atoms (SAs) modification can lead to unprecedented reactivity with recent advances. However, the deactivation of SAs-modified photocatalysts remains a critical challenge in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this study, we unveil the detrimental effect of CO intermediates on Cu single atoms (Cu-SAs) during photocatalytic CO2 reduction, leading to clustering and deactivation on TiO2. To address this, we developed a novel Cu-SAs anchored on Au porous nanoparticles (CuAu-SAPNPs-TiO2) via a vectored etching approach. This system not only enhances CH4 production with a rate of 748.8 µmol·g-1·h-1 and 93.1% selectivity but also mitigates Cu-SAs clustering, maintaining stability over 7 days. This sustained high performance, despite the exceptionally high efficiency and selectivity in CH4 production, highlights the CuAu-SAPNPs-TiO2 overarching superior photocatalytic properties. Consequently, this work underscores the potential of tailored SAs-based systems for efficient and durable CO2 reduction by reshaping surface adsorption dynamics and optimizing the thermodynamic behavior of the SAs."
38885824,"Barcoding Brazilian mammals to monitor biological diversity and threats: trends, perspectives, and knowledge gaps.","DNA barcoding and environmental DNA (eDNA) represent significant advances for biomonitoring the world's biodiversity and its threats. However, these methods are highly dependent on the presence of species sequences on molecular databases. Brazil is one of the world's largest and most biologically diverse countries. However, many knowledge gaps still exist for describing, identifying, and monitoring of mammalian biodiversity using molecular methods. We aimed to unravel the patterns of the presence of Brazilian mammal species on molecular databases to improve our understanding of how effectively it would be to monitor them using DNA barcoding and environmental DNA, and contribute to mammalian conservation. We foundt many gaps in molecular databases, with many taxa being poorly represented, particularly from Amazonia, the order Lagomorpha, and arboreal, gomivorous, near extinct, and illegally traded species. Moreover, our analyses revealed that species description year was the most important factor determining the probability of a species to being sequenced. Primates are the group with the highest number of species considered a priority for sequencing due to their high level of combined threats. We highlight where investments are needed to fill knowledge gaps and increase the representativity of species on molecular databases to enable a better monitoring ability of Brazilian mammals encompassing different traits using DNA barcoding and environmental DNA."
38885944,"Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate in Victoria, Australia; unintended consequences of changing Medicare Benefits Schedule access.","ObjectiveTo assess whether prostate biopsy rates have altered with the July 2018 change in Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) rebates supporting multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for diagnosing prostate cancer.MethodsBiopsy data (both trans-rectal and trans-perineal) were obtained from the Victorian Agency for Health Information from July 2016 to June 2022. The data were stratified by financial year, age group and hospital type (public vs private). Comparison was made between rates pre and post the mpMRI MBS code change.ResultsThere was an 11.9% increase in the number of biopsies performed per year compared to the pre-MBS change period. There is a significant decreasing trend (P<0.001-4) in number of biopsies in the 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69-year-old age groups with a significant increasing trend (P<0.001) in the 70-79 and 80-89-year-old age groups. There was a 32.9% reduction in the mean number of biopsies performed per year in public hospitals, compared with an 18.3% increase in private.ConclusionContrary to expectations, and proposed funding, there has been an increase in the number of prostate biopsies since MRI became more easily available. This change will put increased pressure on the health budget and the large increase in biopsies in elderly patients was not anticipated when the changes were proposed. A review of the criteria is suggested."
38886316,Vaccarin Ameliorates Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity via Inhibition of p38 MAPK Mediated Mitochondrial Dysfunction.,"Doxorubicin is a frequently used chemotherapeutic agent for treating various malignancies. However, it leads to severe cardiotoxic side effects, such as heart failure, and elevates the risk of sudden cardiac death among cancer patients. While oxidative stress has been identified as the primary cause of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, therapeutic antioxidant approaches have yielded unsatisfactory outcomes. The aim of this study is to explore the therapeutic potential of vaccarin, an active flavonoid glycoside extracted from traditional Chinese herbal agent Semen Vaccariae, in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. We observed that vaccarin significantly ameliorates doxorubicin-induced heart dysfunction in mouse model and suppresses oxidative stress mediated cell apoptosis via specifically inhibiting the activation of p38 MAPK pathway. In vitro, we observed that vaccarin alleviates doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ROS generation in H9c2 cell, but the p38 MAPK agonist anisomycin reverses these effects. Our findings provide a promising natural antioxidant to protect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity."
38886930,Cell polarization in ischemic stroke: molecular mechanisms and advances.,"Ischemic stroke is a cerebrovascular disease associated with high mortality and disability rates. Since the inflammation and immune response play a central role in driving ischemic damage, it becomes essential to modulate excessive inflammatory reactions to promote cell survival and facilitate tissue repair around the injury site. Various cell types are involved in the inflammatory response, including microglia, astrocytes, and neutrophils, each exhibiting distinct phenotypic profiles upon stimulation. They display either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory states, a phenomenon known as 'cell polarization.' There are two cell polarization therapy strategies. The first involves inducing cells into a neuroprotective phenotype in vitro, then reintroducing them autologously. The second approach utilizes small molecular substances to directly affect cells in vivo. In this review, we elucidate the polarization dynamics of the three reactive cell populations (microglia, astrocytes, and neutrophils) in the context of ischemic stroke, and provide a comprehensive summary of the molecular mechanisms involved in their phenotypic switching. By unraveling the complexity of cell polarization, we hope to offer insights for future research on neuroinflammation and novel therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke."

38887632,Bone Health in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.,"The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and skeletal fragility is complex, with effects on bone at the cellular, molecular, and biomechanical levels. As a result, people with T2DM, compared to those without, are at increased risk of fracture, despite often having preserved bone mineral density (BMD) on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Maladaptive skeletal loading and changes in bone architecture (particularly cortical porosity and low cortical volumes, the hallmark of diabetic osteopathy) are not apparent on routine DXA. Alternative imaging modalities, including quantitative computed tomography and trabecular bone score, allow for noninvasive visualization of cortical and trabecular compartments and may be useful in identifying those at risk for fractures. Current fracture risk calculators underestimate fracture risk in T2DM, partly due to their reliance on BMD. As a result, individuals with T2DM, who are at high risk of fracture, may be overlooked for commencement of osteoporosis therapy. Rather, management of skeletal health in T2DM should include consideration of treatment initiation at lower BMD thresholds, the use of adjusted fracture risk calculators, and consideration of metabolic and nonskeletal risk factors. Antidiabetic medications have differing effects on the skeleton and treatment choice should consider the bone impacts in those at risk for fracture. T2DM poses a unique challenge when it comes to assessing bone health and fracture risk. This article discusses the clinical burden and presentation of skeletal disease in T2DM. Two clinical cases are presented to illustrate a clinical approach in assessing and managing fracture risk in these patients."
38885941,"Improving equitable access to publicly funded bariatric surgery in Queensland, Australia.","BackgroundPeople living in regional Queensland, Australia, have less access to health care than their metropolitan neighbours; a gap that is wider if they are also of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ethnicity. The Bariatric Surgery Initiative (BSI) aims to provide metabolic bariatric surgery as a public service accessible to all Queenslanders for patients with morbid obesity according to need, regardless of location or ethnicity.MethodsWe investigated the BSI's progress in closing the metro-regional gap by comparing the distribution of referrals for surgery with the geographic and ethnic spread of obesity across Queensland in 2017-2019.ResultsRegional Queensland is home to 59.8% of Queensland's individuals with obesity, whereas 40.2% live in metropolitan Brisbane. In contrast, 47.8% of referrals were from regional areas, with 52.2% received from Brisbane. We found that more patients from metropolitan than regional areas underwent metabolic bariatric surgery, probably due to a paucity of referrals from regional locations. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were able to access the service and all patients realised significant health benefits after surgery.ConclusionsThe BSI improved access to this service, and inequities in metro-regional access may depend on patient choice and healthcare provider awareness of the BSI.Trial registrationThis initiative was a quality improvement study focused on providing access to care rather than a clinical trial; as such it was not registered as a clinical trial."
38885797,DCUN1D1 and neddylation: Potential targets for cancer therapy.,"Cancer affects millions of people and understanding the molecular mechanisms related to disease development and progression is essential to manage the disease. Post-translational modification (PTM) processes such as ubiquitination and neddylation have a significant role in cancer development and progression by regulating protein stability, function, and interaction with other biomolecules. Both ubiquitination and neddylation are analogous processes that involves a series of enzymatic steps leading to the covalent attachment of ubiquitin or NEDD8 to target proteins. Neddylation modifies the CRL family of E3 ligase and regulates target proteins' function and stability. The DCUN1D1 protein is a regulator of protein neddylation and ubiquitination and acts promoting the neddylation of the cullin family components of E3-CRL complexes and is known to be upregulated in several types of cancers. In this review we compare the PTM ubiquitination and neddylation. Our discussion is focused on the neddylation process and the role of DCUN1D1 protein in cancer development. Furthermore, we provide describe DCUN1D1 protein and discuss its role in pathogenesis and signalling pathway in six different types of cancer. Additionally, we explore both the neddylation and DCUN1D1 pathways as potential druggable targets for therapeutic interventions. We focus our analysis on the development of compounds that target specifically neddylation or DCUN1D1. Finally, we provide a critical analysis about the challenges and perspectives in the field of DCUN1D1 and neddylation in cancer research. KEY POINTS: Neddylation is a post-translational modification that regulates target proteins' function and stability. One regulator of the neddylation process is a protein named DCUN1D1 and it is known to have its expression deregulated in several types of cancers. Here, we provide a detailed description of DCUN1D1 structure and its consequence for the development of cancer. We discuss both the neddylation and DCUN1D1 pathways as potential druggable targets for therapeutic interventions and provide a critical analysis about the challenges and perspectives in the field of DCUN1D1 and neddylation in cancer research."
38886369,Topological abnormalities of the morphometric similarity network of the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia.,"A morphometric similarity (MS) network can be constructed using multiple magnetic resonance imaging parameters of each cortical region. An MS network can be used to assess the similarity between cortical regions. Although MS networks can detect microstructural alterations and capture connections between histologically similar cortical areas, the influence of schizophrenia on the topological characteristics of MS networks remains unclear. We obtained T1- and diffusion-weighted images of 239 healthy controls and 190 individuals with schizophrenia to construct the MS network. Group comparisons of the mean MS of the cortical regions and subnetworks were performed. The strengths of the connections between the cortical regions and the global and nodal network indices were compared between the groups. Clinical associations with the network indices were tested using Spearman's rho. Compared with healthy controls, individuals with schizophrenia had significant group differences in the mean MS of several cortical regions and subnetworks. Individuals with schizophrenia had both superior and inferior strengths of connections between cortical regions compared with those of healthy controls. We observed regional abnormalities of the MS network in individuals with schizophrenia regarding lower centrality values of the pars opercularis, superior frontal, and superior temporal areas. Specific nodal network measures of the right pars opercularis and left superior temporal areas were associated with illness duration in individuals with schizophrenia. We identified regional abnormalities of the MS network in schizophrenia with the left superior temporal area possibly being a key region in topological organization and cortical connections."
38887791,Comparing automated cell imaging with conventional methods of measuring cell proliferation and viability.,"The ability to assess cell proliferation and viability is essential for assessing new drug treatments, particularly in cancer drug discovery. This study describes a new method that uses a plate reader digital microscopy cell imaging and analysis system to assess cell proliferation and viability. This imaging system utilizes high throughput fluorescence microscopy with two fluorescent probes: cell membrane-impermeable SYTOX green and nuclear binding Hoechst-33342. Here we compare this technology to other known viability assays, namely: propidium iodide (PI)-based flow cytometry, and sulforhodamine B (SRB) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) based plate reader assays. These methods were assessed based on their effectiveness in detecting the cell numbers of two adherent cell lines and one suspension cell line. Automated cell imaging was most accurate at measuring cell number in both adherent and suspension cell lines. The PI-based flow cytometry method was more difficult to use with adherent cells, while the SRB and MTT assays had difficulties when monitoring cells in suspension. Despite these challenges, it was possible to obtain similar results when quantifying the effect of cytotoxic compounds. This study demonstrates that the digital microscopy automated cell imaging system is an effective method for assessing cell proliferation and the cytotoxic effect of compounds on both adherent and suspension cell lines."
38887151,Evaluation of Short-Term Mussel Test for Estimating Toxicity.,"Effect concentrations of ammonia, nickel, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride from short-term 7-day tests were compared to those from standard chronic 28-day toxicity tests with juvenile mussels (fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea) to evaluate the sensitivities of the 7-day tests. The effect concentrations for nickel (59 µg Ni/L), chloride (316-519 mg Cl/L, a range from multiple tests), and potassium (15 mg K/L) obtained from the 7-day tests were within a range of effect concentrations for each corresponding chemical in the 28-day tests (41-91 µg Ni/L, 251->676 mg Cl/L, 15-23 mg K/L), whereas the 7-day ammonia effect concentration (0.40 mg/L total ammonia nitrogen; TAN) was up to 3.3-fold greater than the 28-day effect concentrations (0.12-0.36 mg TAN/L) but with overlapped 95% confidence limits. These results indicate that the 7-day tests produced similar estimates compared to the 28-day tests. Further studies are needed to evaluate the 7-day test sensitivity using additional chemicals with different modes of toxic action. Environ Toxicol Chem 2024;00:1-6. Published 2024.

38886497,Genome-wide identification of starch phosphorylase gene family in Rosa chinensis and expression in response to abiotic stress.,"Chinese rose (Rosa chinensis) is an important ornamental plant, with economic, cultural, and symbolic significance. During the application of outdoor greening, adverse environments such as high temperature and drought are often encountered, which affect its application scope and ornamental quality. The starch phosphorylase (Pho) gene family participate in the synthesis and decomposition of starch, not only related to plant energy metabolism, but also plays an important role in plant stress resistance. The role of Pho in combating salinity and high temperature stress in R. chinensis remains unknown. In this work, 4 Phos from R. chinensis were detected with Pfam number of Pho (PF00343.23) and predicted by homolog-based prediction (HBP). The Phos are characterized by sequence lengths of 821 to 997 bp, and the proteins are predicted to subcellularly located in the plastid and cytoplasm. The regulatory regions of the Phos contain abundant stress and phytohormone-responsive cis-acting elements. Based on transcriptome analysis, the Phos were found to respond to abiotic stress factors such as drought, salinity, high temperature, and plant phytohormone of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. The response of Phos to abiotic stress factors such as salinity and high temperature was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. To evaluate the genetic characteristics of Phos, a total of 69 Phos from 17 species were analyzed and then classified into 3 groups in phylogenetic tree. The collinearity analysis of Phos in R. chinensis and other species was conducted for the first time. This work provides a view of evolution for the Pho gene family and indicates that Phos play an important role in abiotic stress response of R. chinensis."
38887337,Endoscopic Combined Drainage of One Giant and Multiple Small Pancreatic Pseudocysts: A Case Report.,"A pancreatic pseudocyst (PPC) is a frequent complication of pancreatitis, often stemming from alcohol, gallstones, or hyperlipidemia. Endoscopic treatment of PPC has become the mainstream treatment. A case of one giant and multiple small PPCs was observed, manifesting as repeated abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after meals. Initial computed tomography scans revealed the presence of multiple PPCs. Despite ineffective medical treatment, the pseudocysts progressively increased. In response, we conducted a combined endoscopic intervention, involving Hot AXIOS (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) stenting through endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural drainage (EUS-TMD) and the placement of the endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage (ENPD) mimic stent through endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). Remarkably, after nine months of postoperative follow-up, the patient had no discomfort symptoms and the cyst disappeared. We conducted a literature review on endoscopic combined drainage for PPCs, which is still controversial. Our presented case serves as a demonstration that endoscopic combined drainage can effectively and successfully manage giant and multiple PPCs."
38886115,Single-cell sequencing unveils extensive intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer/testis antigen expression in melanoma and lung cancer.,"Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are widely expressed in melanoma and lung cancer, emerging as promising targets for vaccination strategies and T-cell-based therapies in these malignancies. Despite recognizing the essential impact of intratumoral heterogeneity on clinical responses to immunotherapy, our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity in CTA expression has remained limited. We employed single-cell mRNA sequencing to delineate the CTA expression profiles of cancer cells in clinically derived melanoma and lung cancer samples. Our findings reveal a high degree of intratumoral transcriptional heterogeneity in CTA expression. In melanoma, every cell expressed at least one CTA. However, most individual CTAs, including the widely used therapeutic targets NY-ESO-1 and MAGE, were confined to subpopulations of cells and were uncoordinated in their expression, resulting in mosaics of cancer cells with diverse CTA profiles. Coordinated expression was observed, however, mainly among highly structurally and evolutionarily related CTA genes. Importantly, a minor subset of CTAs, including PRAME and several members of the GAGE and MAGE-A families, were homogenously expressed in melanomas, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Extensive heterogeneity in CTA expression was also observed in lung cancer. However, the frequency of CTA-positive cancer cells was notably lower and homogenously expressed CTAs were only identified in one of five tumors in this cancer type. Our findings underscore the need for careful CTA target selection in immunotherapy development and clinical testing and offer a rational framework for identifying the most promising candidates."
38886569,Role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of castration-resistant prostate cancer: a comprehensive study using sequencing and animal models.,"CRPC remains a significant challenge in prostate cancer research. We aimed to elucidate the role of gut microbiota and its specific mechanisms in CRPC using a multidisciplinary approach. We analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing data from mouse fecal samples, revealing substantial differences in gut microbiota composition between CRPC and castration-sensitive prostate cancer mice, particularly in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Functional analysis suggested different bacteria may influence CRPC via the α-linolenic acid metabolism pathway. In vivo, experiments utilizing mouse models and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) demonstrated that FMT from healthy control mice could decelerate tumor growth in CRPC mice, reduce TNF-α levels, and inhibit the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Transcriptome sequencing identified crucial genes and pathways, with rescue experiments confirming the gut microbiota's role in modulating CRPC progression through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. The activation of this pathway by TNF-α has been corroborated by in vitro cell experiments, indicating its role in promoting prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis. Gut microbiota dysbiosis may promote CRPC development through TNF-α activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, potentially linked to α-linolenic acid metabolism."
38887828,"Advances in skin gene therapy: utilizing innovative dressing scaffolds for wound healing, a comprehensive review.","The skin, serving as the body's outermost layer, boasts a vast area and intricate structure, functioning as the primary barrier against external threats. Disruptions in the composition and functionality of the skin can lead to a diverse array of skin conditions, such as wounds, burns, and diabetic ulcers, along with inflammatory disorders, infections, and various types of skin cancer. These disorders not only exacerbate concerns regarding skin health and beauty but also have a significant impact on mental well-being. Due to the complexity of these disorders, conventional treatments often prove insufficient, necessitating the exploration of new therapeutic approaches. Researchers develop new therapies by deciphering these intricacies and gaining a thorough understanding of the protein networks and molecular processes in skin. A new window of opportunity has opened up for improving wound healing processes because of recent advancements in skin gene therapy. To enhance skin regeneration and healing, this extensive review investigates the use of novel dressing scaffolds in conjunction with gene therapy approaches. Scaffolds that do double duty as wound protectors and vectors for therapeutic gene delivery are being developed using innovative biomaterials. To improve cellular responses and speed healing, these state-of-the-art scaffolds allow for the targeted delivery and sustained release of genetic material. The most recent developments in gene therapy techniques include RNA interference, CRISPR-based gene editing, and the utilization of viral and non-viral vectors in conjunction with scaffolds, which were reviewed here to overcome skin disorders and wound complications. In the future, there will be rare chances to develop custom methods for skin health care thanks to the combination of modern technology and collaboration among disciplines."
38886889,Living Kidney Donation: A Narrative Review of Mid- and Long-term Psychosocial Outcomes.,"Living kidney donors make a significant contribution to alleviating the organ shortage. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of mid- and long-term (≥12 mo) living donor psychosocial outcomes and highlight areas that have been understudied and should be immediately addressed in both research and clinical practice. We conducted a narrative review by searching 3 databases. A total of 206 articles were included. Living donors can be divided into those who donate to an emotionally or genetically related person, the so-called directed donors, or to an emotionally or genetically unrelated recipient, the so-called nondirected donors. The most commonly investigated (bio)psychosocial outcome after living donation was health-related quality of life. Other generic (bio)psychological outcomes include specific aspects of mental health such as depression, and fatigue and pain. Social outcomes include financial and employment burdens and problems with insurance. Donation-specific psychosocial outcomes include regret, satisfaction, feelings of abandonment and unmet needs, and benefits of living kidney donation. The experience of living donation is complex and multifaceted, reflected in the co-occurrence of both benefits and burden after donation. Noticeably, no interventions have been developed to improve mid- or long-term psychosocial outcomes among living donors. We highlight areas for methodological improvement and identified 3 areas requiring immediate attention from the transplant community in both research and clinical care: (1) recognizing and providing care for the minority of donors who have poorer long-term psychosocial outcomes after donation, (2) minimizing donation-related financial burden, and (3) studying interventions to minimize long-term psychosocial problems."
38887219,Modification of the existing maximum residue levels in various plant commodities resulting from the use of potassium phosphonates.,"In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicants De Sangosse SAS and Tilco-Alginure submitted two requests, respectively, to the competent national authorities in France and Germany to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance potassium phosphonates in various plant commodities. The data submitted in support of the requests were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for the commodities under assessment. For the derived MRL on baby leaf crops, further risk manager consideration is required to decide between two MRL options. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of potassium phosphonates in accordance with the residue definition 'phosphonic acid and its salts expressed as phosphonic acid' in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results and assuming that the existing MRLs will be amended as proposed by EFSA in previous outputs, EFSA concluded that the long-term intake of residues resulting from the existing uses of fosetyl and phosphonates (previously assessed in a joint MRL review) and new proposed uses of potassium phosphonates is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health. Considering the toxicological profile of the active substance, a short-term dietary risk assessment was not required. The risk assessment shall be regarded as indicative because some MRL proposals derived by EFSA in the framework of the MRL review according to Articles 12 and 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 require further consideration by risk managers."
38887390,Ferroptosis and circular RNAs: new horizons in cancer therapy.,"Cancer poses intricate challenges to treatment due to its complexity and diversity. Ferroptosis and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as innovative therapeutic avenues amid the evolving landscape of cancer therapy. Extensive investigations into circRNAs reveal their diverse roles, ranging from molecular regulators to pivotal influencers of ferroptosis in cancer cell lines. The results underscore the significance of circRNAs in modulating molecular pathways that impact crucial aspects of cancer development, including cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. A detailed analysis delineates these pathways, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms through which circRNAs influence ferroptosis. Building upon recent experimental findings, the study evaluates the therapeutic potential of targeting circRNAs to induce ferroptosis. By identifying specific circRNAs associated with the etiology of cancer, this analysis paves the way for the development of targeted therapeutics that exploit vulnerabilities in cancer cells. This review consolidates the existing understanding of ferroptosis and circRNAs, emphasizing their role in cancer therapy and providing impetus for ongoing research in this dynamic field.

38886009,"III-Nitride Magnetron Sputter Epitaxy on Si: Controlling Morphology, Crystal Quality, and Polarity Using Al Seed Layers.","Group III-nitride semiconductors have been subject of intensive research, resulting in the maturing of the material system and adoption of III-nitrides in modern optoelectronics and power electronic devices. Defined film polarity is an important aspect of III-nitride epitaxy as the polarity affects the design of electronic devices. Magnetron sputtering is a novel approach for cost-effective epitaxy of III-nitrides nearing the technological maturity needed for device production; therefore, control of film polarity is an important technological milestone. In this study, we show the impact of Al seeding on the AlN/Si interface and resulting changes in crystal quality, film morphology, and polarity of GaN/AlN stacks grown by magnetron sputter epitaxy. X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate the improvement of the crystal quality of the AlN and subsequently the GaN film by the Al seeding. Nanoscale structural and chemical investigations using scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal the inversion of the AlN film polarity. It is proposed that N-polar growth induced by Al seeding is related to the formation of a polycrystalline oxygen-rich AlN interlayer partially capped by an atomically thin Si-rich layer at the AlN/Si interface. Complementary aqueous KOH etch studies of GaN/AlN stacks demonstrate that purely metal-polar and N-polar layers can be grown on a macroscopic scale by controlling the amount of Al seeding."
38887075,The skin barrier and microbiome in infantile atopic dermatitis development: can skin care prevent onset?,"Atopic dermatitis (AD), a prevalent Th2-dominant skin disease, involves complex genetic and environmental factors, including mutations in the Filaggrin gene and dysbiosis of skin microbiota characterized by an increased abundance of Staphylococcus aureus. Our recent findings emphasize the pivotal role of the skin barrier's integrity and microbial composition in infantile AD and allergic diseases. Early skin dysbiosis predisposes infants to AD, suggesting targeted skincare practices as a preventive strategy. The effects of skincare interventions, particularly the application of moisturizers with the appropriate molar concentration of ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids, play a crucial role in restoring the skin barrier. Notably, our study revealed that appropriate skincare can reduce Streptococcus abundance while supporting Cutibacterium acnes presence, thus directly linking skincare practices to microbial modulation in neonatal skin. Despite the mixed outcomes of previous Randomized Controlled Trials on the efficacy of moisturizers in AD prevention, our research points to the potential of skincare intervention as a primary preventive method against AD by minimizing the impact of genetic and environmental factors. Furthermore, our research supports the notion that early aggressive management of eczema may reduce the incidence of food allergies, highlighting the necessity for multifaceted prevention strategies that address both the skin barrier and immune sensitization. By focusing on repairing the skin barrier and adjusting the skin's microbiome from birth, we propose a novel perspective on preventing infantile AD and allergic diseases, opening new avenues for future studies and practices in allergy prevention."
38886477,Stability evaluation of open-pit mine slope based on Bayesian optimization 1D-CNN.,"As mechanized open-pit coal mining intensifies, assessing and predicting slope stability has become increasingly important. To address the limitations of traditional mechanical calculations, numerical simulations, and physical experiments, this paper identifies the key factors impacting slope stability in open-pit mines and develops a multi-parameter sample data set. The study employs hyperparameters optimized using a Bayesian algorithm, introduces additional convolutional layers, and combines the Adam optimizer with dropout techniques to enhance the feature extraction and performance of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN). This leads to a Bayesian-optimized one-dimensional convolutional neural network (B-1D MCNN) model for predicting slope stability.The study evaluates the classification performance and accuracy of various models for slope stability, including BP neural networks, genetic algorithm-optimized convolutional neural networks, 1D-CNN, and B-1D MCNN, using accuracy, precision, and F1-score as metrics. The analysis also examines the influence of factor indicators and training set length on the model's output to assess its generalization capabilities.The research findings suggest that: (1) the B-1D MCNN model for evaluating slope stability demonstrates the capability to accurately depict the nonlinear correlation between influencing factors and slope stability. (2) Compared with other models, the B-1D MCNN model has shown enhancements of 10.96% to 27.85%, 10.26% to 28.55%, and 8.98% to 25.05% in terms of Accuracy, F1-Score, and Precision, respectively. (3) As the length of the training dataset increases, the performance of the model improves accordingly. (4) The B-1D MCNN model shows a generalization power of 87.5%."
38887543,STING agonist-conjugated metal-organic framework induces artificial leukocytoid structures and immune hotspots for systemic antitumor responses.,"Radiotherapy is widely used for cancer treatment, but its clinical utility is limited by radioresistance and its inability to target metastases. Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown promise as high-Z nanoradiosensitizers to enhance radiotherapy and induce immunostimulatory regulation of the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that MOFs could deliver small-molecule therapeutics to synergize with radiotherapy for enhanced antitumor efficacy. Herein, we develop a robust nanoradiosensitizer, GA-MOF, by conjugating a STING agonist, 2',3'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (GA), on MOFs for synergistic radiosensitization and STING activation. GA-MOF demonstrated strong anticancer efficacy by forming immune-cell-rich nodules (artificial leukocytoid structures) and transforming them into immunostimulatory hotspots with radiotherapy. Further combination with an immune checkpoint blockade suppressed distant tumors through systemic immune activation. Our work not only demonstrates the potent radiosensitization of GA-MOF, but also provides detailed mechanisms regarding MOF distribution, immune regulatory pathways and long-term immune effects."
38887628,Dynamics of self-control during choice and post-choice consumption quantity.,"Observed choices between options representing a relative vice and a relative virtue have commonly been used as a measure of eating self-control in the literature. However, even though self-control operations may manifest across the post-choice consumption stage, either similarly or in different ways from the choice stage, most prior research has ignored consumption quantity of the chosen option. While the behavior of choosing a virtue instead of a vice does manifest self-control, we examine how this plays out in post-choice consumption. Specifically, we find that when processing resources are limited, after having chosen a virtue food, unrestrained eaters ironically consumed greater quantities and therefore more calories than restrained eaters (Study 1). This reflects more persistent self-control in the post-choice consumption stage among restrained eaters than unrestrained eaters, and occurs because choosing a virtue lowers accessibility of the self-control goal among unrestrained eaters relative to restrained eaters (Study 2), thereby increasing intake of the virtuous food. In contrast, subsequent to having chosen a vice, unrestrained eaters and restrained eaters did not show any such difference in intake (Study 1) or goal accessibility (Study 2). Together, these results reveal that persistence of self-control in the post-choice consumption stage depends on individuals' dietary restraint and their initial exercise of self-control in the choice decision. The mere act of choosing a virtue satisfies unrestrained eaters' self-control goal and leads to increased food intake, whereas the same act keeps the same goal activated among restrained eaters who reduce intake of the chosen virtue. Put differently, persistent self-control across choice and quantity decisions is observed only when those with a dietary goal show successful self-control enactment in the choice stage. We therefore highlight that the operation of self-control can be dynamic within a consumption episode, and thus, choice and post-choice quantity are both informative of self-control."
38886960,Salsolinol as an RNA m6A methylation inducer mediates dopaminergic neuronal death by regulating YAP1 and autophagy.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202503000-00032/figure1/v/2024-06-17T092413Z/r/image-tiff Salsolinol (1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, Sal) is a catechol isoquinoline that causes neurotoxicity and shares structural similarity with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, an environmental toxin that causes Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanism by which Sal mediates dopaminergic neuronal death remains unclear. In this study, we found that Sal significantly enhanced the global level of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation in PC12 cells, mainly by inducing the downregulation of the expression of m6A demethylases fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5). RNA sequencing analysis showed that Sal downregulated the Hippo signaling pathway. The m6A reader YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2) promoted the degradation of m6A-containing Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) mRNA, which is a downstream key effector in the Hippo signaling pathway. Additionally, downregulation of YAP1 promoted autophagy, indicating that the mutual regulation between YAP1 and autophagy can lead to neurotoxicity. These findings reveal the role of Sal on m6A RNA methylation and suggest that Sal may act as an RNA methylation inducer mediating dopaminergic neuronal death through YAP1 and autophagy. Our results provide greater insights into the neurotoxic effects of catechol isoquinolines compared with other studies and may be a reference for assessing the involvement of RNA methylation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease."
38885894,JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibition by AG490 ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis via regulation of Th17 cells and autophagy.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition affecting the central nervous system, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models have been extensively used to study it. T-helper 17 cells, which produce interleukin-17(IL-17), play crucial roles in MS pathogenesis, and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway has an essential function in their differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells. This study investigated the effects of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibitor AG490 on EAE in vivo and in vitro, as well as the underlying mechanisms. AG490 ameliorated EAE severity and attenuated its typical symptoms by downregulating proteins associated with the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, it decreased T-helper 17 cell differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells by inactivating STAT3. In addition, it conferred protective effects against EAE by restoring autophagy. These findings indicate the potential of AG490 as a candidate anti-MS therapeutic."

38886509,Structural and biophysical insights into targeting of claudin-4 by a synthetic antibody fragment.,"Claudins are a 27-member family of ~25 kDa membrane proteins that integrate into tight junctions to form molecular barriers at the paracellular spaces between endothelial and epithelial cells. As the backbone of tight junction structure and function, claudins are attractive targets for modulating tissue permeability to deliver drugs or treat disease. However, structures of claudins are limited due to their small sizes and physicochemical properties-these traits also make therapy development a challenge. Here we report the development of a synthetic antibody fragment (sFab) that binds human claudin-4 and the determination of a high-resolution structure of it bound to claudin-4/enterotoxin complexes using cryogenic electron microscopy. Structural and biophysical results reveal this sFabs mechanism of select binding to human claudin-4 over other homologous claudins and establish the ability of sFabs to bind hard-to-target claudins to probe tight junction structure and function. The findings provide a framework for tight junction modulation by sFabs for tissue-selective therapies."
38887298,Establishment of a prognostic model for hypoxia-associated genes in OPSCC and revelation of intercellular crosstalk.,"Hypoxia exerts a profound influence on the tumor microenvironment and immune response, shaping treatment outcomes and prognosis. Utilizing consistency clustering, we discerned two hypoxia subtypes in OPSCC bulk sequencing data from GEO. Key modules within OPSCC were identified through weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Core modules underwent CIBERSORT immune infiltration analysis and GSEA functional enrichment. Univariate Cox and LASSO analyses were employed to construct prognostic models for seven hypoxia-related genes. Further investigation into clinical characteristics, the immune microenvironment, and TIDE algorithm prediction for immunotherapy response was conducted in high- and low-risk groups. scRNA-seq data were visually represented through TSNE clustering, employing the scissors algorithm to map hypoxia phenotypes. Interactions among cellular subpopulations were explored using the Cellchat package, with additional assessments of metabolic and transcriptional activities. Integration with clinical data unveiled a prevalence of HPV-positive patients in the low hypoxia and low-risk groups. Immunohistochemical validation demonstrated low TDO2 expression in HPV-positive (P16-positive) patients. Our prediction suggested that HPV16 E7 promotes HIF-1α inhibition, leading to reduced glycolytic activity, ultimately contributing to better prognosis and treatment sensitivity. The scissors algorithm effectively segregated epithelial cells and fibroblasts into distinct clusters based on hypoxia characteristics. Cellular communication analysis illuminated significant crosstalk among hypoxia-associated epithelial, fibroblast, and endothelial cells, potentially fostering tumor proliferation and metastasis."
38887410,Using Learning Analytics to Evaluate the Clinical Education Podcast Format.,"Learning analytics has been rigorously applied to various forms of e-learning, but not to the evaluation of clinical education podcasts. We created a podcast series using the Anchor by Spotify platform, uploading an episode every 2 weeks starting on March 30, 2021. We examined analytics data using a censoring date of November 1, 2022. Based on 29,747 total plays, average audience retention declined 10%/minute until an inflection point at 2.5 minutes, followed by a steady decline of 1.8%/minute. With a maximum episode length of 17 minutes, we did not identify a limit on learner attention for short-form podcasts."
38886037,Use of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides to target SH2 domains: Antagonist peptides of the Crk/CrkL-p130Cas axis.,"Protein-protein interactions between SH2 domains and segments of proteins that include a post-translationally phosphorylated tyrosine residue (pY) underpin numerous signal transduction cascades that allow cells to respond to their environment. Dysregulation of the writing, erasing, and reading of these posttranslational modifications is a hallmark of human disease, notably cancer. Elucidating the precise role of the SH2 domain-containing adaptor proteins Crk and CrkL in tumor cell migration and invasion is challenging because there are no specific and potent antagonists available. Crk and CrkL SH2s interact with a region of the docking protein p130Cas containing 15 potential pY-containing tetrapeptide motifs. This chapter summarizes recent efforts toward peptide antagonists for this Crk/CrkL-p130Cas interaction. We describe our protocol for recombinant expression and purification of Crk and CrkL SH2s for functional assays and our procedure to determine the consensus binding motif from the p130Cas sequence. To develop a more potent antagonist, we employ methods often associated with structure-based drug design. Computational docking using Rosetta FlexPepDock, which accounts for peptides having a greater number of conformational degrees of freedom than small organic molecules that typically constitute libraries, provides quantitative docking metrics to prioritize candidate peptides for experimental testing. A battery of biophysical assays, including fluorescence polarization, differential scanning fluorimetry and saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were employed to assess the candidates. In parallel, GST pulldown competition assays characterized protein-protein binding in vitro. Taken together, our methodology yields peptide antagonists of the Crk/CrkL-p130Cas axis that will be used to validate targets, assess druggability, foster in vitro assay development, and potentially serve as lead compounds for therapeutic intervention."
38887775,Mechanisms of microbial resistance against cadmium - a review.,"The escalating cadmium influx from industrial activities and anthropogenic sources has raised serious environmental concerns due to its toxic effects on ecosystems and human health. This review delves into the intricate mechanisms underlying microbial resistance to cadmium, shedding light on the multifaceted interplay between microorganisms and this hazardous heavy metal. Cadmium overexposure elicits severe health repercussions, including renal carcinoma, mucous membrane degradation, bone density loss, and kidney stone formation in humans. Moreover, its deleterious impact extends to animal and plant metabolism. While physico-chemical methods like reverse osmosis and ion exchange are employed to mitigate cadmium contamination, their costliness and incomplete efficacy necessitate alternative strategies. Microbes, particularly bacteria and fungi, exhibit remarkable resilience to elevated cadmium concentrations through intricate resistance mechanisms. This paper elucidates the ingenious strategies employed by these microorganisms to combat cadmium stress, encompassing metal ion sequestration, efflux pumps, and enzymatic detoxification pathways. Bioremediation emerges as a promising avenue for tackling cadmium pollution, leveraging microorganisms' ability to transform toxic cadmium forms into less hazardous derivatives. Unlike conventional methods, bioremediation offers a cost-effective, environmentally benign, and efficient approach. This review amalgamates the current understanding of microbial cadmium resistance mechanisms, highlighting their potential for sustainable remediation strategies. By unraveling the intricate interactions between microorganisms and cadmium, this study contributes to advancing our knowledge of bioremediation approaches, thereby paving the way for safer and more effective cadmium mitigation practices."
38887682,Mortality prevention as the centre of COPD management.,"COPD is a major healthcare problem and cause of mortality worldwide. COPD patients at increased mortality risk are those who are more symptomatic, have lower lung function and lower diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, decreased exercise capacity, belong to the emphysematous phenotype and those who have concomitant bronchiectasis. Mortality risk seems to be greater in patients who experience COPD exacerbations and in those who suffer from concomitant cardiovascular and/or metabolic diseases. To predict the risk of death in COPD patients, several composite scores have been created using different parameters. In previous years, large studies (also called mega-trials) have evaluated the efficacy of different therapies on COPD mortality, but until recently only nonpharmaceutical interventions have proven to be effective. However, recent studies on fixed combinations of triple therapy (long-acting β-agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids) have provided encouraging results, showing for the first time a reduction in mortality compared to dual therapies. The aim of the present review is to summarise available data regarding mortality risk in COPD patients and to describe pharmacological therapies that have shown effectiveness in reducing mortality."
38886776,Biomechanics of circulating cellular and subcellular bioparticles: beyond separation.,"Biomechanical attributes have emerged as novel markers, providing a reliable means to characterize cellular and subcellular fractions. Numerous studies have identified correlations between these factors and patients' medical status. However, the absence of a thorough overview impedes their applicability in contemporary state-of-the-art therapeutic strategies. In this context, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the dimensions, configuration, rigidity, density, and electrical characteristics of normal and abnormal circulating cells. Subsequently, the discussion broadens to encompass subcellular bioparticles, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched either from blood cells or other tissues. Notably, cell sizes vary significantly, from 2 μm for platelets to 25 μm for circulating tumor cells (CTCs), enabling the development of size-based separation techniques, such as microfiltration, for specific diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Although cellular density is relatively constant among different circulating bioparticles, it allows for reliable density gradient centrifugation to isolate cells without altering their native state. Additionally, variations in EV surface charges (-6.3 to -45 mV) offer opportunities for electrophoretic and electrostatic separation methods. The distinctive mechanical properties of abnormal cells, compared to their normal counterparts, present an exceptional opportunity for diverse medical and biotechnological approaches. This review also aims to provide a holistic view of the current understanding of popular techniques in this domain that transcend conventional boundaries, focusing on early harvesting of malignant cells from body fluids, designing effective therapeutic options, cell targeting, and resonating with tissue and genetic engineering principles."
38886545,RUNX1 regulates MCM2/CDC20 to promote COAD progression modified by deubiquitination of USP31.,"Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is the second leading cause of cancer death, and there is still a lack of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA database was used to obtain RUNX1, a gene with prognostic value in COAD. RUNX1 plays an important role in many malignancies, and its molecular regulatory mechanisms in COAD remain to be fully understood. To explore the physiological role of RUNX1, we performed functional analyses, such as CCK-8, colony formation and migration assays. In addition, we investigated the underlying mechanisms using transcriptome sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RUNX1 is highly expressed in COAD patients and significantly correlates with survival. Silencing of RUNX1 significantly slowed down the proliferation and migratory capacity of COAD cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CDC20 and MCM2 may be target genes of RUNX1, and that RUNX1 may be physically linked to the deubiquitinating enzyme USP31, which mediates the upregulation of RUNX1 protein to promote transcriptional function. Our results may provide new insights into the mechanism of action of RUNX1 in COAD and reveal potential therapeutic targets for this disease."
38887552,Analysis and discussion on the pharmaceutical centralized procurement implementation - a case study of a large provincial hospital in China.,"Unaffordable medical treatment and inflated drug prices have become a challenging issue for lawmakers worldwide. To reduce the financial burden and standardize the pharmaceutical market, the Chinese government has issued several detailed regulations, including the measures of drug recruitment and procurement in one and volume purchasing to not only ensure the high quality of approved drugs but also lower the cost of the production and sell procedure. In this work, to have a thorough overview of the enforcement of these regulations, we attempted to critically analyze the data of our hospital's centralized procurement of drugs from 2019 to 2022. We identified some concerns, such as the difficulty in determining the ""quantity"" of drug procurement, out-of-stock of collectively procured drugs, difficulty in managing the preallocation of associated funds, incomplete centralized procurement systems, etc. Therefore, it is essential to promote a multidimensional strategy, including the combination of the medical insurance reform and drug centralized procurement policies, strict controlling of the forecast quantity of drugs to ensure stable drug supply, improvement of the relevant policies for retaining the surplus of centralized procurement drug medical insurance funds, secureness of the drug procurement system platform, and available reference and guidance for subsequent centralized quantity procurement of drugs."
38886353,Accelerometer-derived physical activity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes.,"Physical activity (PA) has been shown to reduce diabetes mortality, but largely based on imprecise self-reported data, which may hinder the development of related recommendations. Here, we perform a prospective cohort study of 19,624 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the UK Biobank with a median follow-up of 6.9 years. Duration and intensity of PA are measured by wrist-worn accelerometers over a 7-day period. We observe L-shaped associations of longer duration of PA, regardless of PA intensity, with risks of all-cause and cancer mortality, as well as a negatively linear association with cardiovascular disease mortality. 12.7%, 15.8%, and 22.3% of deaths are attributable to the lowest level of light-intensity, moderate-intensity PA, and vigorous-intensity PA, respectively. Collectively, our findings provide insights for clinical guidelines that should highlight the potential value of adherence to greater intensity and duration of PA for patients with T2D."
38888009,Characterisation of magnetic atomic and molecular beamlines for the extraction of empirical scattering-matrices.,"A recently developed magnetic molecular interferometry technique allows the experimental determination of how the amplitudes and phases of the molecular wave-function change during the collision of a gas phase molecule with a surface. This information, quantified by a scattering-matrix, provides a very stringent benchmark for developing accurate theoretical models as they can also be determined from scattering calculations and are particularly sensitive to the underlying interaction potential. However, the value of this comparison is necessarily limited by the accuracy with which an empirical scattering-matrix can be extracted from the experimental data. This paper presents the methods used to analyse the measurements and uses simulations to determine how various uncertainties in modelling the different magnetic elements which make up the beamline of the apparatus affect the accuracy with which the scattering-matrix can be extracted. It is shown that when signals have a noise level which corresponds to on the order of 1% of the oscillation amplitude, the uncertainties in the modelling do not significantly affect the ability to extract the scattering-matrix elements, with the error in the extracted values increasing to a few percent as the noise in the signals is increased to 10% of the oscillation amplitude. This therefore gives an estimate of the accuracy of the parameters that can be obtained from future measurements."
38887887,Carbon Nanotube Loading Strategies for Peptide Drugs: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be regarded as a potential platform for transmembrane drug delivery as many experimental works have demonstrated their capability to effectively transport bioactive molecules into living cells. Within this framework, the loading of a peptide drug onto either the interior or exterior of CNTs has gained considerable interest. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive comparison of these two loading methods. To this end, we performed molecular dynamics simulations and the umbrella sampling technique to investigate the interaction energy, conformational changes, and free energy changes of a model peptide drug containing α-helical structure interacting with the inner or outer walls of a 14.7-nm-long (20,20) CNT. Our finding reveals that, for a tube of such dimensions, it is thermodynamically more favorable for the peptide to be loaded onto the inner tube wall than the outer tube wall, primarily due to a larger free energy change for the former strategy. Conversely, unloading the drug from the tube interior poses greater challenges. Moreover, the tube's curvature plays an essential role in influencing the conformation of the adsorbed peptide. Despite the relatively weaker van der Waals interaction between the CNT exterior and the peptide, loading the peptide onto the exterior may induce significant conformational changes, particularly affecting the peptide's α-helix structure. In contrast, loading of the peptide on the CNT interior could maintain most of the α-helical content. CNTs do not typically attract specific peptide residues, with adsorbed groups primarily determined by the peptide's configurations and orientations. Finally, we offer a guideline for selecting an optimal loading strategy for CNT-based drug delivery."
38887191,Effect of rare earth ion substitution on phase decomposition of apatite structure.,"The paper describes an investigation of phase decomposition of apatite lattice doped with rare earth ions (cerium, samarium, and holmium) at temperatures ranging from 25 to 1200 ºC. The rare-earth ion-doped apatite minerals were synthesized using sol-gel method. In situ high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to observe phase changes and the lattice parameters were analyzed to ascertain the crystallographic transformations. The expansion coefficient of the compounds was determined, and it was found that the c-axis was the most expandable due to relatively weak chemical bonds along the c-crystallographic axis. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to examine the decomposition properties of the materials. Due to rare earth ion doping, the produced materials had slightly variable decomposition behaviour. The cerium and samarium ions were present in multiple oxidation states (Ce3+, Ce4+, Sm3+, Sm2+), whereas only Ho3+ ions were observed. Rare earth ion substitution affects tri-calcium phosphate proportion during decomposition by regulating concentrations of vacancies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that cerium and samarium ion-doped apatite yielded only 25% tricalcium phosphate during decomposition. This finding advances our understanding of apatite structures, with implications for various high-temperature processes like calcination, sintering, hydrothermal processing, and plasma spraying."
38887357,Bridging Communication Gaps: A Study on Effective Patient Communication Among Respiratory Therapy Students and Interns.,"Introduction Effective communication in healthcare plays a pivotal role, significantly impacting patient experiences and outcomes. While much of the current literature focuses on communication dynamics among physicians and nurses, a gap exists in understanding these dynamics within allied health professions such as respiratory therapy. This study explores the knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of patient communication among respiratory therapy students and interns. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of effective communication methods with patients among respiratory therapy students and interns in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Using a validated self-administered questionnaire, the study surveyed 350 individuals from three universities and associated hospitals. Results The analysis involved 350 participants, with females comprising 55.1%. The study found that the highest level of agreement (mean 4.6±0.62) was regarding essential knowledge related to introducing respiratory therapists to patients during communication. Female students demonstrated significant proficiency in concluding patient interviews (P=0.033), while male students excelled in comprehending communication methods with unconscious patients (P=0.010). Interns exhibited the most comprehensive understanding of patient communication skills, particularly in employing open-ended questions (P=0.009) and allowing adequate time for patients to express their concerns (P=0.020). Gender and academic progression were identified as factors influencing patient communication skills in respiratory therapy students and interns. Conclusion This study highlights the need for tailored communication training for respiratory therapy students and interns. It emphasizes the importance of enhancing proficiency in this vital field by addressing knowledge gaps and identifying areas for improvement."
38887748,Utilization of Digital Periodontal and Restorative Dentistry in Full Mouth Reconstruction: A Case Report.,"CT-guided surgery has demonstrated superior accuracy over traditional methods in the dental literature. However, inherent errors such as discrepancies between jaw dimensions in scans and reality can challenge the fabrication of screw-retained provisional restorations. These discrepancies can impede final restoration fabrication. Traditional immediate loading of edentulous jaws using temporary cylinders in existing dentures often requires time-consuming abutment positioning and drilling. Many articles addressed these issues through minimally invasive implant placement with immediate loading, achieved through careful preoperative planning and exact prosthetic techniques. CT-guided surgery facilitates minimally invasive procedures and immediate restoration of edentulous jaws, resulting in reduced morbidity and quicker, more precise outcomes. This case report illustrates how digital dentistry enhances implant placement precision and reliability. It involves using a lock object system between the surgical guide and provisional restoration, streamlining the process. A 59-year-old male with significant periodontal issues and non-restorable teeth was treated with implant-supported fixed prostheses using digital planning and computer-fabricated surgical guides. The plan included immediate loading with mechanical and magnetic locks for optimal outcomes. The patient received complete fixed provisional restorations on both arches through minimally invasive procedures. Digital dentistry facilitated precise implant placement and restoration, improving function, esthetics, and patient satisfaction. Digital technologies streamlined the process, reducing time and enhancing predictability and reproducibility. In conclusion, integrating digital dentistry into implant treatment planning and execution offers enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and patient outcomes. By utilizing digital technologies and innovative methods, clinicians can attain consistent and reliable outcomes, thereby enhancing the quality of care for patients undergoing implant therapy."
38887285,"Fully equipped CARs to address tumor heterogeneity, enhance safety, and improve the functionality of cellular immunotherapies.","Although adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has achieved unprecedented response rates in patients with certain hematological malignancies, this therapeutic modality is still far from fulfilling its remarkable potential, especially in the context of solid cancers. Antigen escape variants, off-tumor destruction of healthy tissues expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), poor CAR-T cell persistence, and the occurrence of functional exhaustion represent some of the most prominent hurdles that limit CAR-T cell ability to induce long-lasting remissions with a tolerable adverse effect profile. In this review, we summarize the main approaches that have been developed to face such bottlenecks, including the adapter CAR (AdCAR) system, Boolean-logic gating, epitope editing, the modulation of cell-intrinsic signaling pathways, and the incorporation of safety switches to precisely control CAR-T cell activation. We also discuss the most pressing issues pertaining to the selection of co-stimulatory domains, with a focus on strategies aimed at promoting CAR-T cell persistence and optimal antitumor functionality."
38887971,Assessing metabolic rates in zebrafish using a 3D-printed intermittent-flow respirometer and swim tunnel system.,"Zebrafish have become a widely used vertebrate model in physiology and reliable measures of their metabolic rate are needed. We have developed a 3D-printed respirometer and swim tunnel system and used it for obtaining accurate measurement of standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximal, aerobic metabolic rate (MMR) in zebrafish under rest and maximal exercise, respectively. We compared a slow (stepwise) protocol to a fast (continuous) protocol for determining MMR. The fast protocol yielded slightly (but not significantly) higher oxygen consumption rates than the slow protocol and the data, in contrast to the slow protocol, followed a normal distribution. These findings point to the fast protocol as a fast and reliable method for obtaining accurate values of MMR in zebrafish. We make the 3D drawings for printing the system available to researchers, to help streamline the field of metabolic research in zebrafish and other smaller fish species."
38886838,Effects of different natural products in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Due to a scarcity of appropriate therapeutic approaches capable of ameliorating or eliminating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), many researchers have come to focus on natural products based on traditional medicine that can be utilized to successfully treat NAFLD. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects exerted by seven natural products (curcumin, silymarin, resveratrol, artichoke leaf extract, berberine, catechins, and naringenin) on patients with NAFLD. For this purpose, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exclusively. The selected studies were evaluated for methodological quality via the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool, and data analysis software was used to analyze the data accordingly. The RCTs from the earliest available date until September 2022 were collected. This process resulted in 37 RCTs with a total sample size of 2509 patients being included. The results of the network meta-analysis showed that artichoke leaf extract confers a relative advantage in reducing the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (SUCRA: 99.1%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (SUCRA: 88.2%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (SUCRA: 88.9%). Naringenin conferred an advantage in reducing triglyceride (TG) levels (SUCRA: 97.3%), total cholesterol (TC) levels (SUCRA: 73.9%), and improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (SUCRA: 74.9%). High-density catechins significantly reduced body mass index (BMI) levels (SUCRA: 98.5%) compared with the placebo. The Ranking Plot of the Network indicated that artichoke leaf extract and naringenin performed better than the other natural products in facilitating patient recovery. Therefore, we propose that artichoke leaf extract and naringenin may exert a better therapeutic effect on NAFLD. This study may help guide clinicians and lead to further detailed studies."
38887130,Intellectual disability: A potentially treatable condition.,"The application of genomics has greatly increased the diagnosis of specific monogenic causes of intellectual disability and improved our understanding of the neuronal processes that result in cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, families are building rare disease communities and seeking disease-specific treatments to change the trajectory of health and developmental outcomes for their children. To date, treatments for intellectual disability have focussed on metabolic disorders, where early treatment has improved cognition and neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this article, we discuss the treatment strategies that may be possible to change the neurodevelopmental outcome in a broader range of genetic forms of intellectual disability. These strategies include substrate modification, enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy and molecular therapies. We argue that intellectual disability should now be considered a potentially treatable condition and a strong candidate for precision medicine."
38886310,Intraindividual Variability in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: An Ex-Gaussian Approach.,"Higher intraindividual variability (IIV) of response times is consistently noted in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The current study investigated whether an ex-Gaussian estimate of IIV in children ages 6-13 years-old could differentiate between children with and without ADHD. Children completed a computerized go/no-go task to estimate trial-by-trial IIV and a continuous performance test (CPT) to estimate inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Parents completed questionnaires assessing inattention and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. IIV, commission errors, and attention problems as rated by parents were significantly greater in the ADHD group. Groups did not differ on errors of omission, but IIV was predictive of omission errors and parent ratings of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. IIV predicted group membership (ADHD vs Control) whereas errors of omission did not. However, IIV did not improve diagnostic accuracy when parent ratings were used, such that parent ratings were superior at determining diagnosis. Current results support the use of IIV, based on the ex-Gaussian approach, as an objective measure of attention problems over omission errors on sustained attention CPT-type tasks. Additionally, while parent ratings of attention impairment remain the best predictor of ADHD diagnostic status, IIV may be helpful in determining when further assessment is required in the absence of those ratings."
38887623,Gut-directed hypnosis and hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome: a mini-review.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent health condition which can be associated with functional disability and reduced health-related quality of life. IBS is classified as a disorder of the brain-gut axis. IBS is a very heterogenous condition with regards to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the clinical picture and the amount of functional impairment. Within a biopsychosocial model of IBS psychosocial factors can play a role in the in the predisposition, triggering and development of chronicity. Somatic or psychosocial or a mixture of both factors might predominate in an individual patient. Gut-directed hypnosis is a special type of medical hypnosis combining standardised gut-directed suggestions (hypnosis) with suggestions tailored to the psychological characteristics of the patient (hypnotherapy). Of brain-gut behavioral therapies, cognitive bahvioral-based interventions and gut-directed hypnosis have the largest evidence for both short-term and long-term efficacy in controlled trials for IBS and are recommended by current European and North American gastroenterology guidelines as second line treatment options. Standardised gut-directed hypnosis is available by audiotapes and can be part of a multicomponent self-management approach by digital health applications. It can be used - based on the patient's preferences-as first line therapy for mild forms of IBS. Severe forms of IBS require face-to-face interdisciplinary management. Standardised gut-directed hypnosis and hypnotherapy tailored to the individual patient can be part of this approach."
38886622,Women's health and rights in the twenty-first century.,"In the twenty-first century, the complex relationship between women's health and rights has been influenced by a range of interconnected challenges, including gender inequity, reproductive health disparities, maternal mortality and morbidity, and women's inability to access life-saving, high-quality healthcare services including family planning. Going forward, the world needs to find ways to implement the unfinished agenda of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 1994 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thus prioritizing health and rights for women and girls as essential not only to their survival but also to their progress, agency and empowerment. It is also important to consider the interconnection between women's health and rights and climate change, with its disproportionate impact on the well-being of girls and women, and to address the impact and opportunities afforded by digital technologies. By embracing a holistic approach, societies might be able to advance the cause of women's health and rights in a more inclusive and sustainable manner."
38887522,Investigation of the impact of planar microelectrodes on macrophage-mediated mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis.,"Osseointegration commences with foreign body inflammation upon implant placement, where macrophages play a crucial role in the immune response. Subsequently, during the intermediate and late stages of osseointegration, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) migrate and initiate their osteogenic functions, while macrophages support MSCs in osteogenesis. The utilization of ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) covered ITO planar microelectrodes facilitated the simulation of various surface charge to investigate their effects on MSCs' osteogenic differentiation and macrophage polarization and the results indicated a parabolic increase in the promotional effect of both with the rise in piezoelectric coefficient. Furthermore, the surface charge with a piezoelectric coefficient of -18 exhibited the strongest influence on the promotion of M1 polarization of macrophages and the promotion of MSCs' osteogenic differentiation. The impact of macrophage polarization and MSC osteogenesis following the interaction of macrophages affected by surface charge and MSC was ultimately investigated. It was observed that macrophages affected by the surface charge of -18 piezoelectric coefficient still exerted the most profound induced osteogenic effect, validating the essential role of M1-type macrophages in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs."
38886249,Development of the Vietnamese Rape Myths Acceptance Scales: A Web-Based Survey of Young Adults.,"Rape myths-false but widely held beliefs that serve to deny and justify sexual aggression-present a major barrier to reporting and prevention of sexual violence in Vietnam and globally. Based on a parent study aimed at reducing sexual violence at two universities in Hanoi, we developed and assessed a contextualized measure of rape myths among young people in Vietnam. Items from previously validated rape myth acceptance (RMA) scales and data from qualitative research informed the development of 50 items, which were administered to Vietnamese 18-24-year-olds (n = 2,756 total, n = 1,798 cisgender women) via an anonymous link in February 2021. We used factor analysis to explore and test factor structure and multi-group factor analysis to assess measurement equivalence across gender. We calculated item-level discrimination and difficulty parameters and visualized information curves using item response theory analysis, informing the development of a short form. Four hypothesized subconstructs identified in the qualitative data emerged as factors: (1) ""He didn't mean to""; (2) ""She asked for it""; (3) ""It wasn't really rape""; and (4) ""Rape is a deviant event."" A fifth factor, ""She didn't protect herself,"" included four items from formative data. Confirming formative findings and prior literature, cisgender women had lower RMA than cisgender men, particularly on items related to victim-blaming. The Vietnamese Rape Myths Acceptance Scales were internally consistent and equivalent between cisgender men and women, capturing elements specific to the Vietnamese context and providing a tool for campus climate surveys and evaluations of sexual violence prevention programs."
38887167,Ecological transcriptomics reveals stress response pathways of a ground-herb species in a waterlogging gradient of Amazonian riparian forests.,"Environmental stress is a fundamental facet of life and a significant driver of natural selection in the wild. Gene expression diversity may facilitate adaptation to environmental changes, without necessary genetic change, but its role in adaptive divergence remains largely understudied in Neotropical systems. In Amazonian riparian forests, species distribution is predominantly influenced by species' waterlogging tolerance. The flooding gradient delineates distinct wetland forest types, shaping habitats and species characteristics. Here we investigated the molecular basis of environmental stress response in a tropical ground-herb species (Ischnosiphon puberulus) to environmental variation in Amazonian riparian forests. We compared environmental variables and gene expression profiles from individuals collected in two forest types: Igapó and Terra firme in the Amazonian riparian forests. Predictable seasonal flooding poses a significant challenge in Igapó compared to Terra firme environments, with the former presenting higher water column height and longer flooding duration. Our findings suggest that contrasting environmental conditions related to flooding regimes are important drivers of population genetic differentiation and differential gene expression in I. puberulus. Enriched gene ontology terms highlight associations with environmental stresses, such as defence response, water transport, phosphorylation, root development, response to auxin, salicylic acid and oxidative stress. By uncovering key environmental stress response pathways conserved across populations, I. puberulus offers novel genetic insights into the molecular basis of plant reactions to environmental constraints found in flooded areas of this highly biodiverse neotropical ecosystem."
38886489,Association between sleep state misperception and bedtime behavior in patients with chronic insomnia.,"Previous studies on sleep state misperception have objectively evaluated sleep status in special environments using polysomnography. There is a paucity of data from studies that evaluated habitual sleep status in home environments. The present study aimed to investigate sleep state misperception in the home environment of patients with chronic insomnia using a lumbar-worn actigraphy to identify sleep habits associated with sleep state misperception severity. Thirty-one patients and 42 healthy volunteers were included in the insomnia and non-insomnia group, respectively. Participants recorded subjective assessments in sleep diaries, objective assessments with an actigraphy worn for 14 days, and self-assessments using questionnaires. Both groups had similar objective sleep ratings; however, insomnia group had significantly worse subjective ratings (total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and sleep onset latency). A significant correlation was found between subjective and objective total sleep time scores in non-insomnia group but not in insomnia group. Insomnia group had earlier bedtimes, significantly longer bedtimes, and impaired daytime functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale score); additionally, they underestimated their total sleep time, particularly with earlier bedtimes and longer laying durations. Monitoring the sleep status and habits of individuals in home environments could be instrumental in identifying key points for targeted interventions on sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia."
38887851,"Animal models of tendon calcification: Past, present, and future.","Tendon calcification is a common clinical condition that frequently occurs as a complication after tendon injury and surgery, or as an expression of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. This condition can be referred to by various names in clinical practice and literature, including tendon ossification, tendon mineralization, heterotopic ossification, and calcific tendonitis. The exact pathogenesis of tendon calcification remains uncertain, but current mainstream research suggests that calcification is mostly cell mediated. To further elucidate the pathogenesis of tendon calcification and to better simulate the overall process, selecting appropriate experimental animal models is important. Numerous animal models have been utilized in various clinical studies, each with its own set of advantages and limitations. In this review, we have discussed the advancements made in research on animal models of tendon calcification, with a focus on the selection of experimental animals, the sites of injury in these models, and the methods employed for modeling."
38887362,A Novel Makeshift Method to Collect Leaking Epidural Fluid: A Case Report.,"A healthy 34-year-old full-term parturient was admitted to the labor suite where a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) was easily placed on the first attempt for labor analgesia. After an uneventful delivery, the epidural catheter was removed. Two days later, the patient experienced a fluid leak from the puncture site. The fluid was analyzed to determine whether it was an interstitial or a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We describe a novel technique to collect the leaking fluid without admixing fluid from the surrounding area. No previous reports describe a similar technique to diagnose the source of this questionable fluid leak."

Manual refinements included gender balance and discipline distribution. Improvements included ChatGTP's ability to further incorporate GPA and MCAT scores."
38887810,Multicenter Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of Pembrolizumab for Non-small-Cell Lung Cancer in Patients Aged 75 Years and Older.,"Pembrolizumab is a major treatment for recurrent or advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, data on its use and pharmacokinetics (PK) in older patients are limited. This open-label, multicenter, observational study evaluated real-world data on the safety, efficacy, and PK of pembrolizumab in older patients with NSCLC. In 99 patients aged ≥75 years, PK was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on pretreatment samples. Performance status (PS), geriatric assessment (GA), overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. The median age was 78 (75-87) years. PS was 2-3 in 14 patients. The median ORR, PFS, and OS were 47.5%, 8.0, and 20.5 months, respectively. Although PK and ORR were not significantly associated, patients with the lowest Cycle 1-trough quartile (Q1) experienced poorer PFS (Q1 vs. Q2-4; 3.4 vs. 11.8 months, P = 0.006) and OS (Q1 vs. Q2-4; 9.9 vs. 21.7 months, P = 0.005) than in other quartiles overall, and even in the PD-L1 ≥50% subset (PFS, Q1 vs. Q2-4; 4.1 vs. 14.7 months, P = 0.005; OS, Q1 vs. Q2-4; 9.4 vs. 22.1 months, P = 0.010). The Q1 subgroup was characterized by poor PS and lower albumin, and more frequent ""weight loss ≥ 10%"" on the GA. Pembrolizumab therapy had similar PK and efficaciousness in older as well as younger patients. In patients with PS ≥2, low albumin, and vulnerable GA, early increases in PK levels are less likely, potentially diminishing efficacy even when PD-L1 ≥50%."

38886177,Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock Method for a General Configuration State Function Featuring Arbitrarily Complex Spin-Couplings.,"In this work, we present a general spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) implementation that is able to generate self-consistent field (SCF) wave functions for an arbitrary configuration state function (CSF). These CSFs can contain an arbitrary number of unpaired electrons in arbitrary spin-couplings. The resulting method is named CSF-ROHF. We demonstrate that starting from the ROHF energy expression, for example, the one given by Edwards and Zerner, it is possible to obtain the values of the ROHF vector-coupling coefficients by setting up an open-shell for each group of consecutive parallel-coupled spins dictated by the unique spin-coupling pattern of any given CSF. To achieve this important and nontrivial goal, we employ the machinery of the iterative configuration expansion configuration interaction (ICE-CI) method, which is able to tackle general CI problems on the basis of spin-adapted CSFs. This development allows for the efficient generation of SCF spin-eigenfunctions for systems with complex spin-coupling patterns, such as polymetallic chains and metal clusters, while maintaining SCF scaling with system size (quadratic or less, depending on the specific algorithm and approximations chosen)."
38886270,"Enhancing drought resilience: machine learning-based vulnerability assessment in Uttar Pradesh, India.","Drought is a natural and complex climatic hazard. It has both natural and social connotations. The purpose of this study is to use machine learning methods (MLAs) for drought vulnerability (DVM) in Uttar Pradesh, India. There were 18 factors used to determine drought vulnerability, separated into two groups: physical drought and meteorological drought. The study found that the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh is high to very highly prone to drought, which is approximately 31.38% of the area of Uttar Pradesh. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was then used to evaluate the machine learning models (artificial neural networks). According to the findings, the ANN functioned with AUC values of 0.843. For policy actions to lessen drought sensitivity, DVMs may be valuable. Future exploration may involve refining machine learning algorithms, integrating real-time data sources, and assessing the socio-economic impacts to continually enhance the efficacy of drought resilience strategies in Uttar Pradesh."
38886213,The matricellular protein CCN5 prevents anti-VEGF drug-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of retinal pigment epithelium.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the major causes of blindness in the elderly worldwide. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs have been widely used to treat the neovascular type of AMD (nAMD). However, VEGF acts not only as a pro-angiogenic factor but also as an anti-apoptotic factor in the eyes. In this study, we found that anti-VEGF drugs, including bevacizumab (Bev), ranibizumab (Ran), and aflibercept (Afl), induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ARPE-19 cells in vitro, accompanied by the induction of CCN2, a potent pro-fibrotic factor. Similarly, intravitreal injection of Afl into mouse eyes resulted in EMT in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Co-treatment with CCN5, an anti-fibrotic factor that down-regulates CCN2 expression, significantly attenuated the adverse effects of the anti-VEGF drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathway with antagonists of VEGF receptors, SU5416 and ZM323881, induced EMT and up-regulated CCN2 in ARPE-19 cells. Additionally, knock-down of CCN2 with siRNA abolished the adverse effects of the anti-VEGF drugs in ARPE-19 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that anti-VEGF drugs induce EMT in RPE through the induction of CCN2 and that co-treatment with CCN5 attenuates the adverse effects of anti-VEGF drugs in mouse eyes."
38886904,Interplay between diabetes mellitus and atopic dermatitis.,"Inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis (AD) have long been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Indeed, numerous studies show an increased risk of diabetes mellitus in individuals with AD although lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus is also observed in few studies. Though the underlying mechanisms accounting for the reciprocal influence between these two conditions are still unclear, the complex interplay between diabetes mellitus and AD is attributable, in part, to genetic and environmental factors, cytokines, epidermal dysfunction, as well as drugs used for the treatment of AD. Proper management of one condition can mitigate the other condition. In this review, we summarize the evidence of the interaction between diabetes mellitus and AD, and discuss the possible underlying mechanisms by which these two conditions influence each other."
38886729,Vaginal microbial profile of cervical cancer patients receiving chemoradiotherapy: the potential involvement of Lactobacillus iners in recurrence.,"The vaginal microbiome is an immune defense against reproductive diseases and can serve as an important biomarker for cervical cancer. However, the intrinsic relationship between the recurrence and the vaginal microbiome in patients with cervical cancer before and after concurrent chemoradiotherapy is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 125 vaginal microbial profiles from a patient cohort of stage IB-IVB cervical cancer using 16S metagenomic sequencing and deciphered the microbial composition and functional characteristics of the recurrent and non-recurrent both before and after chemoradiotherapy. We demonstrated that the abundance of beneficial bacteria and stability of the microbial community in the vagina decreased in the recurrence group, implying the unique characteristics of the vaginal microbiome for recurrent cervical cancer. Moreover, using machine learning, we identified Lactobacillus iners as the most important biomarker, combined with age and other biomarkers (such as Ndongobacter massiliensis, Corynebacterium pyruviciproducens ATCC BAA-1742, and Prevotella buccalis), and could predict cancer recurrence phenotype before chemoradiotherapy. This study prospectively employed rigorous bioinformatics analysis and highlights the critical role of vaginal microbiota in post-treatment cervical cancer recurrence, identifying promising biomarkers with prognostic significance in the context of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer. The role of L. iners in determining chemoradiation resistance in cervical cancer warrants further detailed investigation. Our results expand our understanding of cervical cancer recurrence and help develop better strategies for prognosis prediction and personalized therapy."
38886481,M133S mutation possibly involve in the ER stress and mitophagy pathway in maintenance hemodialysis patients with occult hepatitis B infection.,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in the absence of detectable HBsAg. OBI is an important risk factor for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Mutations in the HBV preS/S genes can lead to impaired secretion of either HBsAg or S-protein resulting in the accumulation of defective viruses or S protein in cells. In our previous work, the M133S mutation was present in the HBV S gene of maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients with OBI. In this study, we investigated the potential role of amino acid substitutions in S proteins in S protein production and secretion through the construction of mutant S gene plasmids, structural prediction, transcriptome sequencing analysis, and in vitro functional studies. Protein structure prediction showed that the S protein M133S mutant exhibited hydrophilic modifications, with greater aggregation and accumulation of the entire structure within the membrane phospholipid bilayer. Differential gene enrichment analysis of transcriptome sequencing data showed that differentially expressed genes were mainly concentrated in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The expression of heat shock family proteins and ER chaperone molecules was significantly increased in the wild-type and mutant groups, whereas the expression of mitochondria-associated proteins was decreased. Immunofluorescence staining and protein blotting showed that the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein PDI, the autophagy marker LC3, and the lysosome-associated protein LAMP2 co-localized with the S proteins in the wild-type and mutant strains, and their expression was increased. The mitochondria-associated TOMM20 protein was also co-expressed with the S protein, but expression was significantly reduced in the mutant. The M133S mutation in the S gene is expressed as a defective and misfolded protein that accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum causing secretion-impaired endoplasmic reticulum stress, which in turn triggers mitochondrial autophagy and recruits lysosomes to fuse with the autophagosome, leading to mitochondrial clearance. This study preliminarily demonstrated that the mutation of M133S in the S gene can cause OBI and is associated with disease progression, providing a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of OBI."
38886331,A computational approach to assessing the prognostic implications of BRAF and RAS mutations in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid cancer, posing a growing clinical challenge. PTC exhibits two age-related peaks, with established risk factors including family history and radiation exposure. Managing even low-risk, localized PTC cases remain complex, with growing interest in active surveillance as an alternative to immediate surgery. This study employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to explore the predictive value of BRAF and RAS mutations in PTC, shedding light on their impact on disease progression and outcomes. The analyses emphasized the significance of BRAF and RAS mutations in tumor advancement, particularly the unique BRAF V600E mutation associated with aggressive features. The methodology involved scRNA-Seq analysis of PTC and normal samples, unveiling distinct cell clusters and indicating upregulated BRAF and RAS genes. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted altered biological processes and immune-related pathways in PTC. The study consolidated previous research showing the prevalence of BRAF and RAS mutations in PTC, subtypes with distinct molecular profiles, and the impact of TERT promoter mutations on disease severity. In summary, this study unveils the complex interplay of genetic mutations and the cellular microenvironment in PTC through scRNA-Seq. The upregulated BRAF and RAS genes suggest their roles as PTC drivers, and pathway enrichment reveals alterations in immune-related processes. This synthesis of prior research enhances our understanding of PTC's molecular foundations, informing better prognosis and personalized treatment approaches. These insights advance the landscape of PTC management and provide directions for further research."
38885951,The current state and future perspectives of radiotherapy for cervical cancer.,"Radiotherapy is an effective treatment method for cervical cancer and is typically administered as external beam radiotherapy followed by intracavitary brachytherapy. In Japan, center shielding is used in external beam radiotherapy to shorten treatment time and reduce the doses delivered to the rectum or bladder. However, it has several challenges, such as uncertainties in calculating the cumulative dose. Recently, external beam radiotherapy has been increasingly performed with intensity-modulated radiotherapy, which reduces doses to the rectum or bladder without center shielding. In highly conformal radiotherapy, uncertainties in treatment delivery, such as inter-fractional anatomical structure movements, affect treatment outcomes; therefore, image-guided radiotherapy is essential for appropriate and safe performance. Regarding intracavitary brachytherapy, the use of magnetic resonance imaging-based image-guided adaptive brachytherapy is becoming increasingly widespread because it allows dose escalation to the tumor and accurately evaluates the dose delivered to the surrounding normal organs. According to current evidence, a minimal dose of D90% of the high-risk clinical target volume is significantly relevant to local control. Further improvements in target coverage have been achieved with combined interstitial and intracavity brachytherapy for massive tumors with extensive parametrical involvement. Introducing artificial intelligence will enable faster and more accurate generation of brachytherapy plans. Charged-particle therapies have biological and dosimetric advantages, and current evidence has proven their effectiveness and safety in cervical cancer treatment. Recently, radiotherapy-related technologies have advanced dramatically. This review provides an overview of technological innovations and future perspectives in radiotherapy for cervical cancer."
38885812,"Minimal involvement of P-gp and BCRP in oral absorption of ensitrelvir, an oral SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease inhibitor, in a non-clinical investigation.","P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are important transporters causing drug-drug interaction (DDI). Here, we investigated the involvement of P-gp and BCRP in the oral absorption of ensitrelvir in non-clinical studies and estimated the DDI risk mediated by P-gp and BCRP inhibition in humans. Although ensitrelvir is an in vitro P-gp and BCRP substrate, it demonstrated high bioavailability in rats and monkeys after oral administration. Plasma exposures of ensitrelvir following oral administration were comparable in wild type (WT) and Bcrp (-/-) mice. On the other hand, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio of ensitrelvir in the Mdr1a/1b (-/-) mice to the WT mice was 1.92, indicating that P-gp, but not BCRP, was involved in the oral absorption of ensitrelvir. Based on our previous retrospective analyses, such a low AUC ratio (<3) in the Mdr1a/1b (-/-) mice indicates a minimal impact of P-gp on the oral absorption in humans. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that the involvement of both P-gp and BCRP in the oral absorption of ensitrelvir is minimal, and suggest that ensitrelvir has a low risk for DDIs mediated by P-gp and BCRP inhibition in humans."
38888010,Individual and contextual-level predictors of progression in the bystander intervention model.,"The situational model of bystander behavior is a validated 5-step process for understanding intervention in bullying and sexual harassment, yet the individual-level and contextual-level factors that facilitate the progression from one step to the next are not well understood. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether individual characteristics (social-emotional skills, affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and personal attitudes toward bullying and sexual harassment) and contextual-level factors (school climate and perceived peer attitudes toward bullying and sexual harassment) explained the association between subsequent steps of the bystander intervention model. A sample of 788 high school students completed several validated measures of these constructs. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that each step significantly and positively predicted the next step, and the addition of a direct path from accepting responsibility to helping improved model fit. The mediational model indicated that individual-level characteristics had significant direct effects on interpreting bullying and sexual harassment as problems, accepting responsibility, and helping, and indirect effects from noticing the bullying and sexual harassment to all subsequent steps except knowing. In contrast, contextual-level effects contributed to accepting responsibility in an inverse direction."
38887041,Proximal Discourses in Residential Facility Care Providers' Sense-Making of Their Communication with Family Members of a Loved One with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Families often stay involved in the care of a loved one with Alzheimer's disease even after relocation to a residential care facility, and through this transition, communication between the residential care providers and families becomes integral to keeping family informed and providing good care to the patient. However, care providers of people with Alzheimer's living in residential facilities find themselves overwhelmed by expectations related to their caregiving role and struggle with making sense of their experiences. Fifteen care providers of people with Alzheimer's disease living in a residential facility participated in qualitative, semi-structured interviews. Using relational dialectics theory as the framework through which to examine how residential facility care providers make sense of their communication with families of patients with Alzheimer's, analysis revealed three sets of competing proximal discourses: family inclusion and exclusion, reality and positivity, and expert and layperson provision of care. We address conclusions for scholars, implications for care providers and facilities, limitations, and suggestions for future research."
38886512,From spreading depolarization to blood-brain barrier dysfunction: navigating traumatic brain injury for novel diagnosis and therapy.,"Considerable strides in medical interventions during the acute phase of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have brought improved overall survival rates. However, following TBI, people often face ongoing, persistent and debilitating long-term complications. Here, we review the recent literature to propose possible mechanisms that lead from TBI to long-term complications, focusing particularly on the involvement of a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB). We discuss evidence for the role of spreading depolarization as a key pathological mechanism associated with microvascular dysfunction and the transformation of astrocytes to an inflammatory phenotype. Finally, we summarize new predictive and diagnostic biomarkers and explore potential therapeutic targets for treating long-term complications of TBI."
38886939,Lipid droplets in the nervous system: involvement in cell metabolic homeostasis.,"Lipid droplets serve as primary storage organelles for neutral lipids in neurons, glial cells, and other cells in the nervous system. Lipid droplet formation begins with the synthesis of neutral lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum. Previously, lipid droplets were recognized for their role in maintaining lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis; however, recent research has shown that lipid droplets are highly adaptive organelles with diverse functions in the nervous system. In addition to their role in regulating cell metabolism, lipid droplets play a protective role in various cellular stress responses. Furthermore, lipid droplets exhibit specific functions in neurons and glial cells. Dysregulation of lipid droplet formation leads to cellular dysfunction, metabolic abnormalities, and nervous system diseases. This review aims to provide an overview of the role of lipid droplets in the nervous system, covering topics such as biogenesis, cellular specificity, and functions. Additionally, it will explore the association between lipid droplets and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the involvement of lipid droplets in cell metabolic homeostasis related to the nervous system is crucial to determine the underlying causes and in exploring potential therapeutic approaches for these diseases."
38887206,Three-dimensional morphological characterization of blood droplets during the dynamic coagulation process.,"In this study, we employed a method integrating optical coherence tomography (OCT) with the U-Net and Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-Net frameworks within a convolutional neural network for quantitative characterization of the three dimensional whole blood during the dynamic coagulation process. VGG-Net architecture for the identification of blood droplets across three distinct coagulation stages including drop, gelation, and coagulation achieves an accuracy of up to 99%. In addition, the U-Net architecture demonstrated proficiency in effectively segmenting uncoagulated and coagulated portions of whole blood, as well as the background. Notably, parameters such as volume of uncoagulated and coagulated segments of the whole blood were successfully employed for the precise quantification of the coagulation process, which indicates well for the potential of future clinical diagnostics and analyses."
38885843,Promoter hypermethylation-induced downregulation of ITGA7 promotes colorectal cancer proliferation and migration by activating the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway.,"We previously reported that integrin alpha 7 (ITGA7) was downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and CRC cell lines and that the lower expression of ITGA7 in CRC tissues was correlated with distant metastasis, suggesting that ITGA7 may function as a suppressor in CRC. The present research was conducted to further investigate the role and mechanisms of ITGA7 in CRC progression. First, bisulfite modification and genomic sequencing (BSP) results showed that the methylation rate of ITGA7 promoter was higher in 10 CRC tissues than in the matched normal tissues. Additionally, 5-Aza-CdR treatment increased ITGA7 expression in CRC cells. Gain-of-function assays revealed the inhibitory role of ITGA7 in CRC cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing, RT-qPCR, and cytoplasm and nuclear separation and rescue assays indicated that knockdown of ITGA7 activated the transcription of MMP9, SETD7, and ADAM15 by enhancing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Moreover, CoIP and Western blot suggested a mechanistic model in which ITGA7 binds to CKAP4 to block the interaction of CKAP4 and PI3K p85α and thereby suppress the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Accordingly, the current study suggests that ITGA7 functions as a suppressor in CRC progression and that its expression is controlled by promoter methylation."
38887152,Advancements in guided surgical endodontics: A scoping review of case report and case series and research implications.,"This scoping review examined current case series and reports on guided surgical endodontic applications in order to provide a critical platform for future research. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews guidelines were followed. A search on PubMed and Scopus yielded 611 articles, with 17 case reports and 1 series meeting inclusion criteria. Overall, guided surgery addressed anatomical complexities, with 15 articles employing static protocols and 3 dynamic. Results showed minimal iatrogenic errors and reduced chair time, with no postoperative issues reported. Within the cases described, guided endodontic surgery exhibited satisfactory results in management of anatomical complex cases. Cost-effectiveness, the need for adequate follow-up, procedure's reproducibility and accuracy, and objective measurement of the reduction in operative times and iatrogenic errors are some of the limitations in the current reports that need to be considered for planning of future experimental and cohort studies."
38887440,"Floods in Sub-Saharan Africa; Causes, Determinants and Health Consequences.","Climate change has become a global issue and affects various regions at different levels. The hydro-climatic conditions and the natural fragility of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) make it prone to floods. The review was intended to comprehensively explore the determinants of floods in the continent and their effects on public health. An extensive systematic literature search in English was conducted for peer-reviewed papers, abstracts and internet articles, grey literature, and official Government documents and analysed to identify common themes, findings, and outcomes. Finally, the findings were categorized into common themes. The review revealed that the frequency and intensity of precipitations have increased in recent decades in SSA. This is worsened by anthropogenic activities including urban sprawl, population growth, and land use changes. The health effects of floods are diverse, varied, and specific to a particular context which can be immediate and long-term. The economic losses due to the flood events in the continent are huge. In conclusion, Governments across the continent need to give flood management a top priority as part of national disaster preparedness, response, and mitigation. Floods cannot be managed in isolation; it has to be incorporated into national urban planning with urbanization to make cities resilient and sustainable."
38886992,Significant improvement of a nevus spilus-type congenital melanocytic nevus with oral selumetinib.,Giant congenital melanocytic nevi (GCMN) can be cosmetically significant and can lead to melanoma. There is no standard pharmacologic treatment for GCMN. We present the case of an 8-year-old female with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis caused by an NRAS mutation whose nevus spilus-type GCMN improved on oral selumetinib.
38887447,An overview of the treatments for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a very prevalent inherited disease with a wide global distribution and a prevalence rate of approximately 0.2% in the general population. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) caused by sarcomere mutation is the primary reason of HCM. The histopathology feature is that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myocyte disorder and myocardial fibrosis lead to diminished diastolic function, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and arrhythmia, all of which result in serious cardiac complications. Previously, HCM was considered a malignant disease that was almost untreatable. With the improvement of medical standards and increasing awareness of HCM, it has become a highly treatable disease in contemporary times, with a significant decrease in mortality rates. However, there are still significant unmet requirements in the therapy of HCM. This paper draws on more than 100 references from the past four decades and summarizes current advances in the treatment of HCM. The article will review the pathogenesis and types, recent development in pharmacotherapy, invasive treatments and gene therapies, as well as dilemma and future development of HCM."
38886459,"Association between vitamin D insufficiency and depressive symptoms, and functional disability in community-dwelling Brazilian older adults: results from ELSI-Brazil study.","Low serum 25(OH)D levels (< 30 nmol/L) have been associated with increased depressive symptom scores over time, and it is believed that functionality may play a mediating role in the relationship between 25(OH)D and depressive symptoms. To comprehend the association between these factors could have significant implications for public health policy. The aim of this study was to verify the association between simultaneous vitamin D insufficiency and depressive symptoms, and functional disability in community-dwelling older adults. This was a cross-sectional study with data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), collected between 2015 and 2016. The outcomes were functional disability assessed through basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The exposures were vitamin D insufficiency (< 30 nmol/L) and depressive symptoms (≥ 4 points in 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression). Crude and adjusted Poisson regression was performed to estimate associations. A total of 1781 community-dwelling older adults included in this study, 14.6% had disability in ADL and 47.9% in IADL; 59.7% had vitamin D insufficient levels, and 33.2% depressive symptoms. The concomitant presence of vitamin D insufficient and depressive symptoms increased the prevalence of ADL by 2.20 (95% CI: 1.25; 3.86) and IADL by 1.54 (95% CI: 1.24; 1.91), respectively. Therefore, preventive strategies to keep older adults physically and socially active, with a good level of vitamin D, are essential to avoid depression and functional disability."
38887045,How to manage being bullied as a nurse leader.,"Bullying has existed in health and social care organisations for many years. Although researchers have examined the effects of bullying on nurses and nursing students, there has been too little focus on bullying behaviours inflicted directly or indirectly on nurse leaders and managers. This article provides concise and practical guidance for nurses in leadership or management roles on how to identify and manage bullying behaviours directed at themselves. • Overt or covert bullying in nursing can happen at every level of the organisation. • Bullying negatively affects practice, teamwork, staff morale and patient care. • Identifying bullying is the first step in addressing unacceptable behaviours. • Admitting that you may be being bullied and seeking support to manage bullying is a hallmark of an effective nurse leader. REFLECTIVE ACTIVITY: 'How to' articles can help to update your practice and ensure it remains evidence-based. Apply this article to your practice. Reflect on and write a short account of: • How this article might improve your practice when managing being bullied as a nurse leader. • How you could use this information to educate your peers about managing being bullied as a nurse leader."
38886961,Postnatal development of rat retina: a continuous observation and comparison between the organotypic retinal explant model and in vivo development.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202503000-00033/figure1/v/2024-06-17T092413Z/r/image-tiff The organotypic retinal explant culture has been established for more than a decade and offers a range of unique advantages compared with in vivo experiments and cell cultures. However, the lack of systematic and continuous comparison between in vivo retinal development and the organotypic retinal explant culture makes this model controversial in postnatal retinal development studies. Thus, we aimed to verify the feasibility of using this model for postnatal retinal development studies by comparing it with the in vivo retina. In this study, we showed that postnatal retinal explants undergo normal development, and exhibit a consistent structure and timeline with retinas in vivo. Initially, we used SOX2 and PAX6 immunostaining to identify retinal progenitor cells. We then examined cell proliferation and migration by immunostaining with Ki-67 and doublecortin, respectively. Ki-67- and doublecortin-positive cells decreased in both in vivo and explants during postnatal retinogenesis, and exhibited a high degree of similarity in abundance and distribution between groups. Additionally, we used Ceh-10 homeodomain-containing homolog, glutamate-ammonia ligase (glutamine synthetase), neuronal nuclei, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 immunostaining to examine the emergence of bipolar cells, Müller glia, mature neurons, and microglia, respectively. The timing and spatial patterns of the emergence of these cell types were remarkably consistent between in vivo and explant retinas. Our study showed that the organotypic retinal explant culture model had a high degree of consistency with the progression of in vivo early postnatal retina development. The findings confirm the accuracy and credibility of this model and support its use for long-term, systematic, and continuous observation."
38886991,A review of research on social studies instruction for students with intellectual disabilities.,"The content of social studies encompasses various topics such as culture, citizenship, values, geography, and history. However, social studies has historically been an under-researched academic content area for students with intellectual disabilities. The aim of this study was to identify and summarize empirical research on social studies instruction for students with intellectual disabilities. We searched for articles in two electronic databases from 2000 to 2023. We applied seven inclusion criteria to 1709 articles that emerged in databases. A total of 13 empirical studies met the inclusion criteria. We conducted a narrative review across these 13 studies. Results showed that students with intellectual disabilities improved social studies skills through effective instructional strategies including graphic organizers, technology-based instruction, time delay, and task analysis. Also, social studies instruction for students with intellectual disabilities mostly focused on history and geography. We discussed the findings along with their limitations and provided recommendations for future research."
38887241,Large language models in physical therapy: time to adapt and adept.,"Healthcare is experiencing a transformative phase, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Physical therapists (PTs) stand on the brink of a paradigm shift in education, practice, and research. Rather than visualizing AI as a threat, it presents an opportunity to revolutionize. This paper examines how large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and BioMedLM, driven by deep ML can offer human-like performance but face challenges in accuracy due to vast data in PT and rehabilitation practice. PTs can benefit by developing and training an LLM specifically for streamlining administrative tasks, connecting globally, and customizing treatments using LLMs. However, human touch and creativity remain invaluable. This paper urges PTs to engage in learning and shaping AI models by highlighting the need for ethical use and human supervision to address potential biases. Embracing AI as a contributor, and not just a user, is crucial by integrating AI, fostering collaboration for a future in which AI enriches the PT field provided data accuracy, and the challenges associated with feeding the AI model are sensitively addressed."
38887356,Unusual Duplication of Flexor Tendons in the Middle Finger Leading to Trigger Finger: A Case Report and Comprehensive Review.,"Duplication of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon is an extremely uncommon anatomical anomaly found within the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle, with minimal documentation in the current literature. We present the case of a 45-year-old female manual laborer who exhibited symptoms suggestive of trigger finger in her right middle finger. Surgical exploration uncovered a duplicated FDP tendon, a previously unreported anatomical anomaly in this context. Despite attempting conservative treatment initially, surgical intervention involving release of the A1 pulley, excision of the A1 pulley, and identification of the duplicated tendon was performed. The unusual nature of this anatomical variation highlights the need for additional research into its clinical significance and treatment options. This case highlights the significance of conducting comprehensive anatomical assessments to diagnose and treat uncommon variations within the FDS muscle. It underscores the continued need for collaborative research to enhance treatment approaches, especially in instances where trigger finger symptoms are present."
38885935,An Unusual Clinical Presentation of Traumatic Ulcerative Granuloma With Stromal Eosinophilia.,"Traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia (TUGSE) is a reactive and chronic ulcerative lesion that is most frequently found on the tongue. It appears as a large yellowish ulcer with elevated margins and central induration. TUGSEs exhibit a characteristic pattern of regression often spontaneously, following incisional biopsy, or after removal of the potential traumatic trigger. Herein, we present an unusual case of a TUGSE on the anterior maxillary gingiva of a 70-year-old male that regressed following incisional biopsy. Histopathologic evaluation revealed fragments of squamous mucosa and submucosal tissue with large atypical cells mixed with small lymphocytes, abundant eosinophils, and focal clusters of plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed and the large, atypical cells were positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD30 and negative for CD1a, CD8, CD20, CD56, CD117, ALK1, Langerin, and EBER ISH. To our knowledge, this is the first case of TUGSE reported in the anterior maxilla."
38887878,Discovery of the novel KIR2DL3*00111 allele in a Chinese Han individual.,The novel KIR2DL3*00111 allele differs from the closest allele KIR2DL3*00101 by a single silent mutation.
38886363,A tensor decomposition reveals ageing-induced differences in muscle and grip-load force couplings during object lifting.,"Do motor patterns of object lifting movements change as a result of ageing? Here we propose a methodology for the characterization of these motor patterns across individuals of different age groups. Specifically, we employ a bimanual grasp-lift-replace protocol with younger and older adults and combine measurements of muscle activity with grip and load forces to provide a window into the motor strategies supporting effective object lifts. We introduce a tensor decomposition to identify patterns of muscle activity and grip-load force ratios while also characterizing their temporal profiles and relative activation across object weights and participants of different age groups. We then probe age-induced changes in these components. A classification analysis reveals three motor components that are differentially recruited between the two age groups. Linear regression analyses further show that advanced age and poorer manual dexterity can be predicted by the coupled activation of forearm and hand muscles which is associated with high levels of grip force. Our findings suggest that ageing may induce stronger muscle couplings in distal aspects of the upper limbs, and a less economic grasping strategy to overcome age-related decline in manual dexterity."
38887148,Deficiency of SECTM1 impairs corneal wound healing in aging.,"The corneal epithelium is the outermost transparent barrier of the eyeball and undergoes continuous self-renewal by limbal stem cells (LSCs) during its lifetime; however, the impact of aging on LSCs remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that the healing ability of the cornea in elderly macaques (Macaca fascicularis) was significantly decreased compared to that of younger macaques. This delayed wound closure accompanied a disordered cell arrangement and corneal opacity. A novel cytokine, Secreted and Transmembrane 1 (SECTM1), was found to facilitate corneal healing and was upregulated in young macaques upon wounding. Mechanistically, SECTM1 is essential for LSC migration and proliferation, and may partially function through Cell Division Cycle Associated 7 (CDCA7). Notably, the topical application of SECTM1 to aged wounded corneas dramatically promoted re-epithelialization and improved corneal transparency in both mice and macaques. Our work suggests that aging may impair the expression of healing response factors and injury repair in non-human primate corneas, and that SECTM1 application could potentially benefit corneal wound healing in clinical treatment."
38886468,Outcomes and factors associated with prolonged stays among patients admitted to adult intensive care unit in a resource-limited setting: a multicenter chart review.,"The length of stay in an intensive care unit is used as a benchmark for measuring resource consumption and quality of care and predicts a higher risk of readmission. The study aimed to assess the outcome and factors associated with prolonged intensive care unit stays among those admitted to adult intensive care units of selected public hospitals in Addis Ababa from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. A multicenter retrospective chart review was conducted involving 409 adult patients. Binary logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with a prolonged stay and chi-square tests were used to assess associations and differences in outcomes for prolonged stays. The study, involving 409 of 421 individuals, revealed a predominantly male (55.0%) and the median age of study participants was 38, with an interquartile range (27, 55). Approximately 16.9% experienced prolonged stays, resulting in a 43.5% mortality rate. After adjustments for confounders, there were significant associations with prolonged stays for sedative/hypnotics, readmission, and complications. The study revealed that for every six patients admitted to the intensive care unit, one patient stayed longer, with nearly half experiencing mortality, demanding increased attention. The study emphasized the critical need for improvement in addressing associations between sedative/hypnotics, readmissions, complications, and prolonged stays."
38886537,A comprehensive whole genome database of ethnic minority populations.,"China, is characterized by its remarkable ethnical diversity, which necessitates whole genome variation data from multiple populations as crucial tools for advancing population genetics and precision medical research. However, there has been a scarcity of research concentrating on the whole genome of ethnic minority groups. To fill this gap, we developed the Guizhou Multi-ethnic Genome Database (GMGD). It comprises whole genome sequencing data from 476 healthy unrelated individuals spanning 11 ethnic minorities groups in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, including Bouyei, Dong, Miao, Yi, Bai, Gelo, Zhuang, Tujia, Yao, Hui, and Sui. The GMGD database comprises more than 16.33 million variants in GRCh38 and 16.20 million variants in GRCh37. Among these, approximately 11.9% (1,956,322) of the variants in GRCh38 and 18.5% (3,009,431) of the variants in GRCh37 are entirely new and do not exist in the dbSNP database. These novel variants shed light on the genetic diversity landscape across these populations, providing valuable insights with an average coverage of 5.5 ×. This makes GMGD the largest genome-wide database encompassing the most diverse ethnic groups to date. The GMGD interactive interface facilitates researchers with multi-dimensional mutation search methods and displays population frequency differences among global populations. Furthermore, GMGD is equipped with a genotype-imputation function, enabling enhanced capabilities for low-depth genomic research or targeted region capture studies. GMGD offers unique insights into the genomic variation landscape of different ethnic groups, which are freely accessible at https://db.cngb.org/pop/gmgd/ ."
38886297,The impact of hepatic and splenic volumetric assessment in imaging for chronic liver disease: a narrative review.,"Chronic liver disease is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can fully visualise the liver and adjacent structures in the upper abdomen providing a reproducible assessment of the liver and biliary system and can detect features of portal hypertension. Subjective interpretation of CT and MRI in the assessment of liver parenchyma for early and advanced stages of fibrosis (pre-cirrhosis), as well as severity of portal hypertension, is limited. Quantitative and reproducible measurements of hepatic and splenic volumes have been shown to correlate with fibrosis staging, clinical outcomes, and mortality. In this review, we will explore the role of volumetric measurements in relation to diagnosis, assessment of severity and prediction of outcomes in chronic liver disease patients. We conclude that volumetric analysis of the liver and spleen can provide important information in such patients, has the potential to stratify patients' stage of hepatic fibrosis and disease severity, and can provide critical prognostic information. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This review highlights the role of volumetric measurements of the liver and spleen using CT and MRI in relation to diagnosis, assessment of severity, and prediction of outcomes in chronic liver disease patients. KEY POINTS: Volumetry of the liver and spleen using CT and MRI correlates with hepatic fibrosis stages and cirrhosis. Volumetric measurements correlate with chronic liver disease outcomes. Fully automated methods for volumetry are required for implementation into routine clinical practice."
38887418,"It's ""Classical Advice!"" Why Medical Education Should Go Beyond Science.","This article is a reflection on a new (but ancient) definition of medicine, which considers doctors and patients alike from their complex human experiences. It explores the doctor-patient relationship as well as the practice of medicine itself through an historical lens, by examining some of the scholarship of Galen of Pergamum, the ancient Greek doctor and philosopher of the second century CE. The intention is not to give a new, definite answer, but to use an example from the past to look at the matter from a different, perhaps unusual, perspective."
38887354,Evaluation of the Relationship Between Smartphone Addiction and Lower Back Pain and Neck Pain Among Medical Students at Al-Baha University.,"Introduction In recent years, the increased use of smartphones has adversely affected students, leading to issues like musculoskeletal pain. Therefore, our objective was to assess the correlation between smartphone addiction and neck and lower back pain. Methodology An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Baha University, Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Version (SAS-SV) was used to measure the level of smartphone addiction while the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) was utilized to evaluate musculoskeletal pain. Results Smartphone addiction was prevalent in 72% of the participants (n = 293). Significantly, lower back pain was associated with smartphone addiction (p-value = 0.004). However, none of the demographic characteristics were associated with neck or lower back pain (p-value > 0.05). Students in clinical years had a higher risk of neck pain than those in an internship (p-value = 0.048). Conclusion Almost two-thirds of the students were addicted to smartphones, with a significant association with lower back pain. Students addicted to their smartphones had a higher risk of developing lower back pain, while clinical-year students had a higher risk of developing neck pain. It's important to raise awareness about the health and safety dangers linked to smartphones and other devices."
38885807,CD39 transforming cancer therapy by modulating tumor microenvironment.,"CD39 is a pivotal enzyme in cancer, regulating immune response and tumor progression via extracellular ATP and adenosine in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Beyond its established immunoregulatory function, CD39 influences cancer cell angiogenesis and metabolism, opening new frontiers for therapeutic interventions. Current research faces gaps in understanding CD39's full impact across cancer types, with ongoing debates about its potential beyond modulating immune evasion. This review distills CD39's multifaceted roles, examining its dual actions and implications for cancer prognosis and treatment. We analyze the latest therapeutic strategies, highlighting the need for an integrated approach that combines molecular insights with TME dynamics to innovate cancer care. This synthesis underscores CD39's integral role, charting a course for precision oncology that seeks to unravel controversies and harness CD39's therapeutic promise for improved cancer outcomes."
38885909,Integrated strategy for deep profiling of host cell proteins in downstream processing of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies: Novel approach to isolate and digest host cell proteins.,"Host cell proteins (HCPs) are process-related impurities generated during the production of biopharmaceuticals, which may contaminate the final product unless they are efficiently removed. Due to their potential impact on product safety, quality and efficacy, regulatory authorities require removal of HCPs during processing down to trace amounts in final manufactured biopharmaceuticals. The current standard method for detecting HCPs is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which should reveal the total amount of HCPs. A necessary orthogonal technique to get more granular information on HCPs is obtained by application of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques that permit identification and quantification of individual HCPs. However, differences in sample preparation methods and MS acquisition techniques have led to discrepancies in detected HCPs between studies, which may compromise product safety, quality and efficacy. To address this issue, we have developed a novel and reproducible workflow for isolation, digestion, and mass spectrometry detection of HCPs that is applicable to downstream process characterization of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). This article describes a rapid and efficient workflow for the isolation, digestion and identification of HCPs. For the first time, Fc-receptor (FcγRIIIa) affinity chromatography is employed to isolate the HCP fraction from the mAb. Next, the HCPs are precipitated with acetone and digested using a newly developed ""single-pot"" method that improves digestion performance and prevents sample loss of problematic low-abundant HCPs. The new HCP isolation method outperforms protein A affinity chromatography for monitoring problematic HCPs."
38886865,Cleaved TMEM106B forms amyloid aggregates in central and peripheral nervous systems.,"Filaments made of residues 120-254 of transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) form in an age-dependent manner and can be extracted from the brains of neurologically normal individuals and those of subjects with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. TMEM106B filament formation requires cleavage at residue 120 of the 274 amino acid protein; at present, it is not known if residues 255-274 form the fuzzy coat of TMEM106B filaments. Here we show that a second cleavage appears likely, based on staining with an antibody raised against residues 263-274 of TMEM106B. We also show that besides the brain TMEM106B inclusions form in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, where they were mostly found in non-neuronal cells. We confirm that in the brain, inclusions were most abundant in astrocytes. No inclusions were detected in heart, liver, spleen or hilar lymph nodes. Based on their staining with luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes, we confirm that TMEM106B inclusions are amyloids. By in situ immunoelectron microscopy, TMEM106B assemblies were often found in structures resembling endosomes and lysosomes."
38887868,Island restoration to rebuild seabird populations and amplify coral reef functioning.,"Mobile organisms like seabirds can provide important nutrient flows between ecosystems, but this connectivity has been interrupted by the degradation of island ecosystems. Island restoration (via invasive species eradications and the restoration of native vegetation) can reestablish seabird populations and their nutrient transfers between their foraging areas, breeding colonies, and adjacent nearshore habitats. Its diverse benefits are making island restoration increasingly common and scalable to larger islands and whole archipelagos. We identified the factors that influence breeding seabird abundances throughout the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean and conducted predictive modeling to estimate the abundances of seabirds that the archipelago could support under invasive predator eradication and native vegetation restoration scenarios. We explored whether the prey base exists to support restored seabird populations across the archipelago, calculated the nitrogen that restored populations of seabirds might produce via their guano, and modeled the cascading conservation gains that island restoration could provide. Restoration was predicted to increase breeding pairs of seabirds to over 280,000, and prey was predicted to be ample to support the revived seabird populations. Restored nutrient fluxes were predicted to result in increases in coral growth rates, reef fish biomasses, and parrotfish grazing and bioerosion rates. Given these potential cross-ecosystem benefits, our results support island restoration as a conservation priority that could enhance resilience to climatic change effects, such as sea-level rise and coral bleaching. We encourage the incorporation of our estimates of cross-ecosystem benefits in prioritization exercises for island restoration."
38887429,Transudative pleural effusion in pleuritis associated with immunoglobulin G4-related disease diagnosed by thoracoscopy under local anaesthesia.,"Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is a chronic inflammatory condition often characterized by exudative pleural effusions. However, transudative pleural effusions, like in the presented case of an 80-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, are less common but possible. Despite initial treatment with diuretics, the effusion persisted, prompting further investigation. Medical thoracoscopy revealed lymphatic follicle hyperplasia and an abundance of IgG4-positive plasmacytoid cells, confirming IgG4-related pleuritis. This case underscores the importance of considering inflammatory etiologies, such as IgG4-related disease, when faced with unresponsive transudative pleural effusions. Thoracoscopy serves as a valuable diagnostic tool in such scenarios, allowing for precise diagnosis and appropriate management."
38885801,"Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling revealed epigenetic regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway involved in response to Vibrio alginolyticus infection in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.","An essential epigenetic alteration known as DNA methylation is tightly linked to a variety of biological processes, including immune response. To identify the epigenetic regulatory mechanism in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was conducted on C. gigas at 0 h, 6 h, and 48 h after infection with Vibrio alginolyticus. At 6 h and 48 h, a total of 11,502 and 14,196 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.001) compared to 0 h, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were significantly enriched in various biological pathways including immunity, cytoskeleton, epigenetic modification, and metabolic processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that transcription machinery (ko03021) is one of the most important pathways. Integrated transcriptome and methylome analyses allowed identification of 167 and 379 DMG-related DEGs at 6 h and 48 h, respectively. These genes were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway (ko04064) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (ko04668). Interestingly, it's observed that the NF-κB pathway could be activated jointly by TNF Receptor Associated Factor 2 (TRAF2) and Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 3 (BIRC3, the homolog of human BIRC2) which were regulated by DNA methylation in response to the challenge posed by V. alginolyticus infection. Through this study, we provided insightful information about the epigenetic regulation of immunity-related genes in the C. gigas upon V. alginolyticus infection, which will be valuable to understand how invertebrates modulate their innate immune system to defend against bacterial infection."
38887520,Progress in the study of autophagy-related proteins affecting resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in leukemia.,"Leukemia is a life-threatening malignant tumor of the hematopoietic system. Currently, the main treatment modalities are chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, increased drug resistance due to decreased sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drugs presents a major challenge in current treatments. Autophagy-associated proteins involved in autophagy initiation have now been shown to be involved in the development of various types of leukemia cells and are associated with drug resistance. Therefore, this review will explore the roles of autophagy-related proteins involved in four key autophagic processes: induction of autophagy and phagophore formation, phagophore extension, and autophagosome formation, on the development of various types of leukemias as well as drug resistance. Autophagy may become a promising therapeutic target for treating leukemia."
38886289,Evolutionary Strategies AI Addresses Multiple Technical Challenges in Deep Learning Deployment: Proof-of-Principle Demonstration for Neuroblastoma Brain Metastasis Detection.,"Two significant obstacles hinder the advancement of Radiology AI. The first is the challenge of overfitting, where small training data sets can result in unreliable outcomes. The second challenge is the need for more generalizability, the lack of which creates difficulties in implementing the technology across various institutions and practices. A recent innovation, deep neuroevolution (DNE), has been introduced to tackle the overfitting issue by training on small data sets and producing accurate predictions. However, the generalizability of DNE has yet to be proven. This paper strives to overcome this barrier by demonstrating that DNE can achieve satisfactory results in diverse external validation sets. The main innovation of the work is thus showing that DNE can generalize to varied outside data. Our example use case is predicting brain metastasis from neuroblastoma, emphasizing the importance of AI with limited data sets. Despite image collection and labeling advancements, rare diseases will always constrain data availability. We optimized a convolutional neural network (CNN) with DNE to demonstrate generalizability. We trained the CNN with 60 MRI images and tested it on a separate diverse collection of images from over 50 institutions. For comparison, we also trained with the more traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, with the two variants of (1) training from scratch and (2) transfer learning. Our results show that DNE demonstrates excellent generalizability with 97% accuracy on the heterogeneous testing set, while neither form of SGD could reach 60% accuracy. DNE's ability to generalize from small training sets to external and diverse testing sets suggests that it or similar approaches may play an integral role in improving the clinical performance of AI."
38887578,Transition-metal-catalyst-free electroreductive alkene hydroarylation with aryl halides under visible-light irradiation.,"The radical hydroarylation of alkenes is an efficient strategy for accessing linear alkylarenes with high regioselectivity. Herein, we report the electroreductive hydroarylation of electron-deficient alkenes and styrene derivatives using (hetero)aryl halides under mild reaction conditions. Notably, the present hydroarylation proceeded with high efficiency under transition-metal-catalyst-free conditions. The key to success is the use of 1,3-dicyanobenzene as a redox mediator and visible-light irradiation, which effectively suppresses the formation of simple reduction, i.e., hydrodehalogenation, products to afford the desired products in good to high yields. Mechanistic investigations proposed that a reductive radical-polar crossover pathway is likely to be involved in this transformation."
38886172,Four cases of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome presenting with different types of erythrokeratoderma.,"Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) is a multisystem autosomal recessive disorder due to variants of the ABHD5 gene, characterized by lipid vacuoles in the liver and leukocytes, and possible involvement of eyes, ears, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. CDS may present with skin changes, most commonly congenital non- bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma, however erythrokeratoderma-like findings have been rarely reported in CDS patients. Herein, we report clinical, histopathological and genetic findings of four patients with CDS presenting with different clinical forms of erythrokeratoderma (three with progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma-like features and one with erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV)-like features), including one patient with a novel mutation in ABHD5. Although the typical skin finding of CDS syndrome is reported as non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, CDS should also be in the differential diagnosis in patients with EKV-like lesions."
38887536,Spatiotemporal pattern and suitable areas analysis of equine influenza in global scale (2005-2022).,"Equine influenza (EI) is a severe infectious disease that causes huge economic losses to the horse industry. Spatial epidemiology technology can explore the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and occurrence risks of infectious diseases, it has played an important role in the prevention and control of major infectious diseases in humans and animals. For the first time, this study conducted a systematic analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of EI using SaTScan software and investigated the important environmental variables and suitable areas for EI occurrence using the Maxent model. A total of 517 occurrences of EI from 2005 to 2022 were evaluated, and 14 significant spatiotemporal clusters were identified. Furthermore, a Maxent model was successfully established with high prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.920 ± 0.008). The results indicated that annual average ultraviolet radiation, horse density, and precipitation of the coldest quarter were the three most important environmental variables affecting EI occurrence. The suitable areas for EI occurrence are widely distributed across all continents, especially in Asia (India, Mongolia, and China) and the Americas (Brazil, Uruguay, USA, and Mexico). In the future, these suitable areas will expand and move eastward. The largest expansion is predicted under SSP126 scenarios, while the opposite trend will be observed under SSP585 scenarios. This study presents the spatial epidemiological characteristics of EI for the first time. The results could provide valuable scientific insights that can effectively inform prevention and control strategies in regions at risk of EI worldwide."

38886650,Analysis of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes genetic variants and RAR/RXR expression in patients diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome: a case-control study.,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying alcohol metabolism and its regulation, including the effect of polymorphisms in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, is crucial for research on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. The aim of this study was to identify specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in key alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in a cohort of 71 children, including children with fetal alcohol syndrome, children prenatally exposed to ethanol but without fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and controls. We hypothesized that certain genetic variants related to alcohol metabolism may be fixed in these populations, giving them a particular alcohol metabolism profile. In addition, the difference in certain isoforms of these enzymes determines their affinity for alcohol, which also affects the metabolism of retinoic acid, which is key to the proper development of the central nervous system. Our results showed that children prenatally exposed to ethanol without fetal alcohol spectrum disorder traits had a higher frequency of the ADH1B*3 and ADH1C*1 alleles, which are associated with increased alcohol metabolism and therefore a protective factor against circulating alcohol in the fetus after maternal drinking, compared to FAS children who had an allele with a lower affinity for alcohol. This study also revealed the presence of an ADH4 variant in the FAS population that binds weakly to the teratogen, allowing increased circulation of the toxic agent and direct induction of developmental abnormalities in the fetus. However, both groups showed dysregulation in the expression of genes related to the retinoic acid pathway, such as retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor, which are involved in the development, regeneration, and maintenance of the nervous system. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between alcohol metabolism, the retinoic acid pathway and genetic factors in the development of fetal alcohol syndrome."
38887233,Development of liquid biopsy in detection and screening of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignant tumor, which has the characteristics of occult onset, low early diagnosis rate, rapid development and poor prognosis. The reason for the high mortality is partly that pancreatic cancer is usually found in the late stage and missed the best opportunity for surgical resection. As a promising detection technology, liquid biopsy has the advantages of non-invasive, real-time and repeatable. In recent years, the continuous development of liquid biopsy has provided a new way for the detection and screening of pancreatic cancer. The update of biomarkers and detection tools has promoted the development of liquid biopsy. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide many biomarkers for liquid biopsy of pancreatic cancer, and screening tools around them have also been developed. This review aims to report the application of liquid biopsy technology in the detection of pancreatic cancer patients, mainly introduces the biomarkers and some newly developed tools and platforms. We have also considered whether liquid biopsy technology can replace traditional tissue biopsy and the challenges it faces."
38887691,Strategies to Regulate the Degradation and Clearance of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: A Review.,"Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have attracted extensive attention as drug delivery systems because of their unique meso-structural features (high specific surface area, large pore volume, and tunable pore structure), easily modified surface, high drug-loading capacity, and sustained-release profiles. However, the enduring and non-specific enrichment of MSNs in healthy tissues may lead to toxicity due to their slow degradability and hinder their clinical application. The emergence of degradable MSNs provided a solution to this problem. The understanding of strategies to regulate degradation and clearance of these MSNs for promoting clinical trials and expanding their biological applications is essential. Here, a diverse variety of degradable MSNs regarding considerations of physiochemical properties and doping strategies of degradation, the biodistribution of MSNs in vivo, internal clearance mechanism, and adjusting physical parameters of clearance are highlighted. Finally, an overview of these degradable and clearable MSNs strategies for biosafety is provided along with an outlook of the encountered challenges."
38887204,Arterial Stiffness and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is prevalent and associated with a poor prognosis, imposing a significant burden on society. Arterial stiffness is increasingly recognized as a crucial factor in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, affecting diagnosis, management, and prognosis. As a hallmark of vascular aging, arterial stiffness contributes to increased afterload on the left ventricle (LV), leading to diastolic dysfunction, a key feature of HFpEF. Elevated arterial stiffness is linked with common cardiovascular risk factors in HFpEF, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, exacerbating the progression of disease. Studies have demonstrated that patients with HFpEF exhibit significantly higher levels of arterial stiffness compared to those without HFpEF, highlighting the value of arterial stiffness measurements as both diagnostic and prognostic tools. Moreover, interventions aimed at reducing arterial stiffness, whether through pharmacological therapies or lifestyle modifications, have shown potential in improving LV diastolic function and patient outcomes. Despite these advancements, the precise mechanisms by which arterial stiffness contributes to HFpEF are still not fully understood, necessitating the need for further research."
38885999,Tuberculosis immune reconstitution syndrome (TB-IRIS) followed by recurring lymphadenitis up to 8 years post-antituberculous treatment.,"We present the case of a patient with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) coinfection who initially developed paradoxical TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) post-antituberculous treatment and post-antiretroviral therapy initiation. Despite being managed effectively, lymphadenitis recurred as many as three times over the course of several years. Due to consistent culture-negative lymph node biopsies, the recurring lymphadenitis was eventually deemed inflammatory rather than microbiological recurrences. Cessation of anti-TB treatment led to symptom remission followed by a long asymptomatic period, corroborating the immunological nature of the episodes. However, 5 and 6 years after cessation of anti-TB treatment, respectively, lymphadenitis returned. In both instances, her symptoms regressed without treatment with anti-TB drugs. This case underscores the complexities of managing TB-IRIS and the necessity of differentiating between paradoxical TB-IRIS and other paradoxical reactions for appropriate treatment decisions. Recognition of such distinctions is crucial in guiding effective therapeutic interventions in TB-HIV coinfection scenarios."
38886250,"Motivations to Enhance One's Facial Hair: Affiliation, Rivalry, and Stress.","Facial hair is a sexually dimorphic trait with potential evolutionary and sociocultural functions. Bearded men are perceived as dominant, aggressive, and masculine, but also as having better parenting skills. Men may intentionally manage the amount and shape of their facial hair as a part of their self-promotion strategy; however, facial hair management entails costs in terms of time, effort, and money. We explored psychological factors associated with facial hair enhancement motivation among men. A total of 414 men (aged 18-40 years) reported the current amount of their facial hair along with their facial hair enhancement motivations, gender role stress, intrasexual competitiveness, and fundamental social motives. Willingness to care for facial hair was associated with the amount of facial hair men claimed to have and correlated with the fundamental social motives of affiliation and social status, intrasexual competition, and gender role stress. Therefore, facial hair enhancement may be regarded as a self-presentation strategy aimed at acquiring a beneficial position in social networks."
38885898,Physiological consequences of upper airway obstruction in sleep apnea.,"Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is diagnosed and managed by a metric called the apnea- hypopnea index (AHI). The AHI quantifies total number of respiratory events (apnea or hypopnea), disregarding important information on the characteristics and physiological consequences of respiratory events, including, degrees of ventilatory deficit and associated hypoxemia, cardiac autonomic response, and cortical activity. The oversimplification of the disorder by the AHI is considered one of the reasons for divergent findings on the associations of OSA and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in observational and randomized controlled trial studies. Prospective observational cohort studies have demonstrated strong associations of OSA with several cardiovascular diseases while randomized controlled trials of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) intervention have not been able to detect a benefit of CPAP to reduce the risk of CVD. Over the last several years, novel methodologies have been proposed to better quantify the magnitude of OSA-related breathing disturbance and its physiological consequences. As a result, stronger associations with cardiovascular and neurocognitive outcomes have been observed. In this review, we focus on the methods that capture polysomnographic heterogeneity of OSA."
38886996,Propensity score matching for comparative studies: a tutorial with R and Rex.,"Recently, there has been considerable progress in developing new technologies and equipment for the medical field, including minimally invasive surgeries. Evaluating the effectiveness of these treatments requires study designs like randomized controlled trials. However, due to the nature of certain treatments, randomization is not always feasible, leading to the use of observational studies. The effect size estimated from observational studies is subject to selection bias caused by confounders. One method to reduce this bias is propensity scoring. This study aimed to introduce a propensity score matching process between two groups using a practical example with R. Additionally, Rex, an Excel add-in graphical user interface statistical program, is provided for researchers unfamiliar with R programming. Further techniques, such as matching with three or more groups, propensity score weighting and stratification, and imputation of missing values, are summarized to offer approaches for more complex studies not covered in this tutorial."
38886101,The most common mistakes in intensive care - antibiotics.,"The enormous increase in antibiotic resistance and the limited spectrum of new, effective antibiotics are the reasons why we should think about a rational approach to anti-infective therapy. The excessive and non-indicated use of antibiotics while treating critically ill patients can be found quite often in clinical practice. Antibiotic therapy is usually indicated empirically, or it is only based on therapeutic indecision, not just in ICU patients. The antibiotics are administered before taking a sample for microbiological analysis or there is no therapy adjustment based on the laboratory findings. The solution lies in antibiotic stewardship, which is the way to ensure that antibiotics will be sufficiently effective in years to come."
38887394,"Combined non-invasive neuromodulation using transcranial direct current stimulation, motor imagery and action observation for motor, cognitive and functional recovery in cortico-basal degeneration: a single case study.","This case report presents a comprehensive assessment and therapeutic intervention using non-invasive motor cortex neuromodulation for a 70-year-old female patient diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The study followed the CARE guidelines. The patient meets the criteria for probable CBD, with neuroimaging evidence of exclusively cortical impairment. The patient underwent a non-invasive neuromodulation protocol involving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and action observation plus motor imagery (AO+MI). The neuromodulation protocol comprised 20 sessions involving tDCS over the primary motor cortex and combined AO+MI. Anodal tDCS was delivered a 2 mA excitatory current for 20 minutes. AO+MI focused on lower limb movements, progressing over four weeks with video observation and gradual execution, both weekly and monthly. The neuromodulation techniques were delivered online (i.e. applied simultaneously in each session). Outcome measures were obtained at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up (1 month later), and included motor (lower limb), cognitive/neuropsychological and functional assessments. Walking speed improvements were not observed, but balance (Berg Balance Scale) and functional strength (Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test) improved post-treatment. Long-term enhancements in attentional set-shifting, inhibitory control, verbal attentional span, and working memory were found. There was neurophysiological evidence of diminished intracortical inhibition. Functional changes included worsening in Cortico Basal Ganglia Functional Scale score. Emotional well-being and general health (SF-36) increased immediately after treatment but were not sustained, while Falls Efficacy Scale International showed only long-term improvement. The findings suggest potential benefits of the presented neuromodulation protocol for CBD patients, highlighting multifaceted outcomes in motor, cognitive, and functional domains."
38887469,Mitigating Toxic Metal Exposure Through Leafy Greens: A Comprehensive Review Contrasting Cadmium and Lead in Spinach.,"Metals and metalloids (hereafter, metal(loid)s) in plant-based foods are a source of exposure to humans, but not all metal(loid)-food interactions are the same. Differences exist between metal(loid)s in terms of their behavior in soils and in how they are taken up by plants and stored in the edible plant tissue/food. Thus, there cannot be one consistent solution to reducing toxic metal(loid)s exposure to humans from foods. In addition, how metal(loid)s are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the human body differs based on both the metal(loid), other elements and nutrients in the food, and the nutritional status of the human. Initiatives like the United States Food and Drug Administration's Closer to Zero initiative to reduce the exposure of young children to the toxic elements cadmium, lead, arsenic, and mercury from foods warrant careful consideration of each metal(loid) and plant interaction. This review explores such plant-metal(loid) interactions using the example of spinach and the metals cadmium and lead. This review highlights differences in the magnitude of exposure, bioavailability, and the practicality of mitigation strategies while outlining research gaps and future needs. A focus on feasibility and producer needs, informed via stakeholder interviews, emphasizes the need for better analytical testing facilities and grower and consumer education. More research should focus on minimization of chloride inputs for leafy greens to lessen plant-availability of Cd and the role of oxalate in reducing Cd bioavailability from spinach. These findings are applicable to other leafy greens (e.g., kale, lettuce), but not for other plants or metal(loid)s."
38886938,Spastin and alsin protein interactome analyses begin to reveal key canonical pathways and suggest novel druggable targets.,"Developing effective and long-term treatment strategies for rare and complex neurodegenerative diseases is challenging. One of the major roadblocks is the extensive heterogeneity among patients. This hinders understanding the underlying disease-causing mechanisms and building solutions that have implications for a broad spectrum of patients. One potential solution is to develop personalized medicine approaches based on strategies that target the most prevalent cellular events that are perturbed in patients. Especially in patients with a known genetic mutation, it may be possible to understand how these mutations contribute to problems that lead to neurodegeneration. Protein-protein interaction analyses offer great advantages for revealing how proteins interact, which cellular events are primarily involved in these interactions, and how they become affected when key genes are mutated in patients. This line of investigation also suggests novel druggable targets for patients with different mutations. Here, we focus on alsin and spastin, two proteins that are identified as ""causative"" for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia, respectively, when mutated. Our review analyzes the protein interactome for alsin and spastin, the canonical pathways that are primarily important for each protein domain, as well as compounds that are either Food and Drug Administration-approved or are in active clinical trials concerning the affected cellular pathways. This line of research begins to pave the way for personalized medicine approaches that are desperately needed for rare neurodegenerative diseases that are complex and heterogeneous."
38887348,Diagnosis of Type IV Endoleak After Endovascular Aneurysm Repair Using Visualization With Novel Software.,"A Type IV endoleak is a very rare complication following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and differential diagnosis can be difficult. Reported here is a case that showed the development of a Type IV endoleak after an EVAR procedure, for which a novel software was useful to differentiate that from Type I based on visual confirmation. The 89-year-old man was diagnosed with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm, sized 70 mm, as shown by computed tomography (CT). EVAR was performed in a routine fashion using an Endurant II stent graft. Postoperative CT revealed a massive endoleak around the neck that was difficult to differentiate between Types I and IV. The use of the novel software Viewtify (SCIEMENT, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) to visualize the endoleak with surrounding tissues as real-time three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) resulted in confirmation that the endoleak was not from the proximal end but rather the stent graft body. CT findings obtained one week later showed that the endoleak had diminished and no additional procedures were needed. Following a diagnosis of endoleak after EVAR, images viewed with Viewtify helped to confirm the appropriate diagnosis. This novel software was found useful to clarify the position and mechanism of a Type IV endoleak."
38886396,"C-terminally phosphorylated p27 activates self-renewal driver genes to program cancer stem cell expansion, mammary hyperplasia and cancer.","In many cancers, a stem-like cell subpopulation mediates tumor initiation, dissemination and drug resistance. Here, we report that cancer stem cell (CSC) abundance is transcriptionally regulated by C-terminally phosphorylated p27 (p27pT157pT198). Mechanistically, this arises through p27 co-recruitment with STAT3/CBP to gene regulators of CSC self-renewal including MYC, the Notch ligand JAG1, and ANGPTL4. p27pTpT/STAT3 also recruits a SIN3A/HDAC1 complex to co-repress the Pyk2 inhibitor, PTPN12. Pyk2, in turn, activates STAT3, creating a feed-forward loop increasing stem-like properties in vitro and tumor-initiating stem cells in vivo. The p27-activated gene profile is over-represented in STAT3 activated human breast cancers. Furthermore, mammary transgenic expression of phosphomimetic, cyclin-CDK-binding defective p27 (p27CK-DD) increases mammary duct branching morphogenesis, yielding hyperplasia and microinvasive cancers that can metastasize to liver, further supporting a role for p27pTpT in CSC expansion. Thus, p27pTpT interacts with STAT3, driving transcriptional programs governing stem cell expansion or maintenance in normal and cancer tissues."
38887970,Validation of a Questionnaire for Equine Personality Assessement.,"We propose a practical method of assessing the personality of horses using five personality axes. Four evaluators empirically judged 19 horse individuals on specific adjectives for each axis. To validate the questionnaire, four behavioral tests were conducted with these same animals (social interactions, novel object test, bridge test,and arena test). In this tests, the frequency of specific behaviors were evaluated to create a scale related to the same personality adjectives and judge the animals based on their reactions.The questionnaire was reliable in determining the personality of horses, since the results were consistent with those obtained through behavioral tests. Additionally, in this group of horses attention reactions were more frequent than fear reactions, but significant differences occurred among tests. This study proposes a practical questionnaire for owners and trainers to assess the personality of their horses. The application of this tool can improve the relationship between humans and horses, directing a more empathic approach in the everyday routine with these animals."
38887906,Unveiling therapeutic potentials and exploring maternal-fetal health benefits of metformin in pregnancy: A scoping review.,"This scoping review synthesizes evidence on metformin's use during pregnancy, encompassing diverse conditions like gestational diabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and obesity. Metformin demonstrates comparable efficacy to insulin in gestational diabetes, positive outcomes in type 2 diabetes pregnancies, and potential benefits in reducing complications. The review highlights nuances in its effects across conditions, indicating advantages such as reduced risk of macrosomia and cesarean section in gestational diabetes. However, its prophylactic role in preventing gestational diabetes and associated complications remains inconclusive. In obese pregnant women, mixed results are observed, with potential benefits in reducing pre-eclampsia risk. Metformin shows promise in preventing preterm birth and late miscarriage in PCOS pregnancies. Categorizing patient subgroups is crucial for identifying advantages, especially in gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Challenges arise from study heterogeneity, necessitating standardized indications for dosage, timing, and postpartum follow ups. Efforts to identify patient characteristics influencing metformin efficacy are crucial for tailored therapy. Although metformin emerges as a viable option in complicated pregnancies, comprehensive research, standardized protocols, and subgroup identification efforts will enhance clinical utility, ensuring evidence-based therapies and optimal maternal and fetal outcomes. Bridging existing knowledge gaps remains imperative for advancing metformin's role in pregnancy management."
38886048,Cysteamine toxicity presenting with acute encephalopathy and spastic tetraparesis.,"Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disorder usually presenting with renal disease in infancy. As soon as the diagnosis is made, cysteamine (a cystine-depleting medication), is started, significantly improving life expectancy. We describe a young woman taking lifelong cysteamine for nephropathic cystinosis, who became acutely encephalopathic with a spastic tetraparesis secondary to cysteamine toxicity, which was potentially worsened by copper deficiency. On replacing copper and reducing the dose of cysteamine, she made a full neurological recovery. We discuss the case, and review cystinosis and what is known about cysteamine toxicity."
38886681,adhesiomeR: a tool for Escherichia coli adhesin classification and analysis.,"Adhesins are crucial factors in the virulence of bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli. However, to date no resources have been dedicated to the detailed analysis of E. coli adhesins. Here, we provide adhesiomeR software that enables characterization of the complete adhesin repertoire, termed the adhesiome. AdhesiomeR incorporates the most comprehensive database of E. coli adhesins and facilitates an extensive analysis of adhesiome. We demonstrate that adhesiomeR achieves 98% accuracy when compared with experimental analyses. Based on analysis of 15,000 E. coli genomes, we define novel adhesiome profiles and clusters, providing a nomenclature for a unified comparison of E. coli adhesiomes."
38885813,A meta-analysis of Chikungunya virus in neurological disorders.,"Chikungunya disease typically presents with the fever-arthralgia-rash symptom triad. However, an increase in the number of atypical clinical manifestations, particularly neurological disorders, has occurred. The current evidence regarding the pooled prevalence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-associated neurological cases (CANCs) suspected of having an arboviral aetiology is not well-understood. Therefore, this meta-analysis included 19 studies (n = 7319 patients) and aimed to determine the pooled rate of exposure to CANC. The pooled positivity rate of CANC was 12 % (95 % CI: 6-19), and Brazil was overrepresented (11/19). These estimations varied between 3 and 14 % based on the diagnostic method (real-time PCR vs. ELISA-IgM) and biological samples (cerebrospinal fluid or blood specimens) used for detection of CHIKV. Regarding the frequency of CHIKV in neurological clinical subgroups, the rates were higher among patients with myelitis (27 %), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (27 %), Guillain-Barré syndrome (15 %), encephalitis (12 %), and meningoencephalitis (7 %). Our analysis highlights the significant burden of CANC. However, the data must be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the results, which may be related to the location of the studies covering endemic periods and/or outbreaks of CHIKV. Current surveillance resources should also focus on better characterizing the epidemiology of CHIKV infection in neurological disorders. Additionally, future studies should investigate the interactions between CHIKV and neurological diseases with the aim of gaining deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying the cause-and-effect relationship between these two phenomena."
38886218,Uncovering the role of TET2-mediated ENPEP activation in trophoblast cell fate determination.,"Early trophoblast differentiation is crucial for embryo implantation, placentation and fetal development. Dynamic changes in DNA methylation occur during preimplantation development and are critical for cell fate determination. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Recently, we derived morula-like expanded potential stem cells from human preimplantation embryos (hEPSC-em), providing a valuable tool for studying early trophoblast differentiation. Data analysis on published datasets showed differential expressions of DNA methylation enzymes during early trophoblast differentiation in human embryos and hEPSC-em derived trophoblastic spheroids. We demonstrated downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 3 members (DNMT3s) and upregulation of ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenases (TETs) during trophoblast differentiation. While DNMT inhibitor promoted trophoblast differentiation, TET inhibitor hindered the process and reduced implantation potential of trophoblastic spheroids. Further integrative analysis identified that glutamyl aminopeptidase (ENPEP), a trophectoderm progenitor marker, was hypomethylated and highly expressed in trophoblast lineages. Concordantly, progressive loss of DNA methylation in ENPEP promoter and increased ENPEP expression were detected in trophoblast differentiation. Knockout of ENPEP in hEPSC-em compromised trophoblast differentiation potency, reduced adhesion and invasion of trophoblastic spheroids, and impeded trophoblastic stem cell (TSC) derivation. Importantly, TET2 was involved in the loss of DNA methylation and activation of ENPEP expression during trophoblast differentiation. TET2-null hEPSC-em failed to produce TSC properly. Collectively, our results illustrated the crucial roles of ENPEP and TET2 in trophoblast fate commitments and the unprecedented TET2-mediated loss of DNA methylation in ENPEP promoter."
38887113,Progress in research on ablation of thyroid nodules.,"The incidence of thyroid nodules is rising annually. Surgical treatment is effective, but often results in significant trauma, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, and other complications. Recent years have seen significant breakthroughs in thyroid nodule ablation for treating thyroid diseases, although its application remains controversial. The objective was to review the development history and current research status of thyroid nodule ablation to provide a reference for future studies. The literature on thyroid nodule ablation was reviewed, analysing its advantages and disadvantages. The therapeutic effect of thyroid nodule ablation in treating benign thyroid lesions is noteworthy, but issues such as lax treatment indications and excessive medical treatment persist. Initial success has been achieved in treating thyroid malignant lesions, particularly papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). However, the curative effect requires further follow-up verification."
38887526,"Laser synthesis of nanoparticles in organic solvents - products, reactions, and perspectives.","Laser synthesis and processing of colloids (LSPC) is an established method for producing functional and durable nanomaterials and catalysts in virtually any liquid of choice. While the redox reactions during laser synthesis in water are fairly well understood, the corresponding reactions in organic liquids remain elusive, particularly because of the much greater complexity of carbon chemistry. To this end, this article first reviews the knowledge base of chemical reactions during LSPC and then deduces identifiable reaction pathways and mechanisms. This review also includes findings that are specific to the LSPC method variants laser ablation (LAL), fragmentation (LFL), melting (LML), and reduction (LRL) in organic liquids. A particular focus will be set on permanent gases, liquid hydrocarbons, and solid, carbonaceous species generated, including the formation of doped, compounded, and encapsulated nanoparticles. It will be shown how the choice of solvent, synthesis method, and laser parameters influence the nanostructure formation as well as the amount and chain length of the generated polyyne by-products. Finally, theoretical approaches to address the mechanisms of organic liquid decomposition and carbon shell formation are highlighted and discussed regarding current challenges and future perspectives of LSPC using organic liquids instead of water."
38886036,"Thioimidates provide general access to thioamide, amidine, and imidazolone peptide-bond isosteres.","Thioamides, amidines, and heterocycles are three classes of modifications that can act as peptide-bond isosteres to alter the peptide backbone. Thioimidate protecting groups can address many of the problematic synthetic issues surrounding installation of these groups. Historically, amidines have received little attention in peptides due to limitations in methods to access them. The first robust and general procedure for the introduction of amidines into peptide backbones exploits the utility of thioimidate protecting groups as a means to side-step reactivity that ultimately renders existing methods unsuitable for the installation of amidines along the main-chain of peptides. Further, amidines formed on-resin can be reacted to form (4H)-imidazolone heteorcycles which have recently been shown to act as cis-amide isosteres. General methods for heterocyclic installation capable of geometrically restricting peptide conformation are also under-developed. This work is significant because it describes a generally applicable and divergent approach to access unexplored peptide designs and architectures."
38887110,JAK inhibitors in refractory dermatomyositis: A case series.,"This retrospective cohort study assessed the efficacy and safety of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, in 14 patients with refractory dermatomyositis (DM), a multisystemic autoimmune disorder with limited therapeutic options. Results demonstrated a significant median decrease of 21 points and a 76% reduction in the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI) scores, along with a complete resolution of muscular symptoms in 64% of the patients. JAK inhibitors were effective in managing refractory DM across various subtypes with mild and manageable adverse events."
38885996,Exudative pleural effusion during sunitinib treatment.,"Drug-induced pleural effusion is one of the rare causes of exudative pleural effusion and a high index of suspicion is necessary to lead to early diagnosis. We hereby present the case of a young male in his late 30s, known case of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour on sunitinib therapy, who presented with right-sided mild pleural effusion. Diagnostic thoracentesis showed the effusion to be a monomorphic exudate with low adenosine deaminase, which was negative for malignant cells on cytopathology. A contrast-enhanced CT chest revealed an enlarged lymph node (LN) at the 4R station, cytological analysis of which was suggestive of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Infective workup of the LN aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage taken from the right middle lobe was negative. After systematically excluding the usual causes of exudative pleural effusion, sunitinib was considered to be a possible cause and was, therefore, withheld. A repeat chest X-ray after 3 weeks of stopping the drug showed resolution of the pleural effusion."
38886288,Advanced Gastric Cancer: CT Radiomics Prediction of Lymph Modes Metastasis After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,"This study aims to create and assess machine learning models for predicting lymph node metastases following neoadjuvant treatment in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) using baseline and restaging computed tomography (CT). We evaluated CT images and pathological data from 158 patients with resected stomach cancer from two institutions in this retrospective analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had histologically proven gastric cancer. They had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with at least 15 lymph nodes removed. All patients received baseline and preoperative abdominal CT and had complete clinicopathological reports. They were divided into two cohorts: (a) the primary cohort (n = 125) for model creation and (b) the testing cohort (n = 33) for evaluating models' capacity to predict the existence of lymph node metastases. The diagnostic ability of the radiomics-model for lymph node metastasis was compared to traditional CT morphological diagnosis by radiologist. The radiomics model based on the baseline and preoperative CT images produced encouraging results in the training group (AUC 0.846) and testing cohort (AUC 0.843). In the training cohort, the sensitivity and specificity were 81.3% and 77.8%, respectively, whereas in the testing cohort, they were 84% and 75%. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the radiologist were 70% and 42.2% (using baseline CT) and 46.3% and 62.2% (using preoperative CT). In particular, the specificity of radiomics model was higher than that of conventional CT in diagnosing N0 cases (no lymph node metastasis). The CT-based radiomics model could assess lymph node metastasis more accurately than traditional CT imaging in AGC patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy."

38885885,Molecular epidemiology and associated risk factors of Anaplasma marginale in camels and possible co-infections.,"Anaplasma spp. is an important pathogen that affects a wide range of animals, including camels. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of six Anaplasma spp. in 400 camels from Ismailia, Suez, and Sharkia governorates in northern Egypt, as well as their associated risk factors and possible coinfections. Blood and fecal samples were examined using bacterial culture, the vitek2 system, and PCR. Genetic divergence among Anaplasma marginale (A. marginale) isolates was characterized using the msp4 gene. The overall prevalence of A. marginale was 19.5%. Sequencing analysis confirmed the PCR results, and a single A. marginale genotype was recognized by msp4 sequencing. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the study A. marginale isolates clustered together and were close to Egyptian A. marginale identified from buffalo (OP142725 and OP142726). Age, sex, housing type, tick infestation, body conditions, and tick control factors were significantly associated with camel anaplasmosis using a logistic regression model (odds ratio > 1, P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the infection was 2.03, 1.9, 2.6, 1.9, and 1.8 times higher in females, semi-enclosed housing, ages >5 years, tick infestation, and emaciated camels. The risk of infection due to a tick control factor increased by 4.4 and 2.6 times when no control was applied or with irregular control, respectively. This is the first molecular report of A. marginale infection in camels in Ismailia, Suez, and Sharkia in northern Egypt, indicating a moderate prevalence of A. marginale and the involvement of multiple bacterial infections, mainly Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. Thus, it is necessary to develop effective management and control for camel anaplasmosis."
38885917,Influence of early life stress on the excitability of dynorphin neurons in the adult mouse dorsal horn.,"While early life adversity has been associated with a higher risk of developing chronic pain in adulthood, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress during the neonatal period can persistently sensitize developing nociceptive circuits remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the effects of early life stress (ELS) on synaptic integration and intrinsic excitability in dynorphin-lineage (DYN) interneurons within the adult mouse superficial dorsal horn (SDH) which are important for inhibiting mechanical pain and itch. The administration of neonatal limited bedding between postnatal days (P)2 and P9 evoked sex-dependent effects on spontaneous glutamatergic signaling, as female SDH neurons exhibited a higher amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) after ELS while mEPSC frequency was reduced in DYN neurons of the male SDH. Furthermore, ELS decreased the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) selectively in female DYN neurons. As a result, ELS increased the balance of spontaneous excitation vs. inhibition (E:I ratio) in mature DYN neurons of the female, but not male, SDH network. Nonetheless, ELS weakened the total primary afferent-evoked glutamatergic drive onto adult DYN neurons selectively in females, without modifying afferent-evoked inhibitory signaling onto the DYN population. Finally, ELS failed to significantly change the intrinsic membrane excitability of mature DYN neurons in either males or females. Collectively, these data suggest that ELS exerts a long-term influence on the properties of synaptic transmission onto DYN neurons within the adult SDH, which includes a reduction in the overall strength of sensory input onto this important subset of inhibitory interneurons. PERSPECTIVE: This study suggests that chronic stress during the neonatal period influences synaptic function within adult spinal nociceptive circuits in a sex-dependent manner. These findings yield new insight into the potential mechanisms by which early life adversity might shape the maturation of pain pathways in the CNS."
38885883,Potential of tetraploid wheats in plant breeding: a review.,"Domestication syndrome, selection pressure, and modern plant breeding programs have reduced the genetic diversity of the wheat germplasm. For the genetic gains of breeding programs to be sustainable, plant breeders require a diverse gene pool to select genes for resistance to biotic stress factors, tolerance to abiotic stress factors, and improved quality and yield components. Thus, old landraces, subspecies and wild ancestors are rich sources of genetic diversity that have not yet been fully exploited, and it is possible to utilize this diversity. Compared with durum wheat, tetraploid wheat subspecies have retained much greater genetic diversity despite genetic drift and various environmental influences, and the identification and utilization of this diversity can make a greater contribution to the genetic enrichment of wheat. In addition, using the pre-breeding method, the valuable left-behind alleles in the wheat gene pool can be re-introduced through hybridization and introgressive gene flow to create a sustainable opportunity for the genetic gain of wheat. This review provides some insights about the potential of tetraploid wheats in plant breeding and the genetic gains made by them in plant breeding across past decades, and gathers the known functional information on genes/QTLs, metabolites, traits and their direct involvement in wheat resistance/tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses."
38885821,Genetic variants related to insulin metabolism are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus.,"The current study sought to investigate the associations of common genetic risk variants with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk in the north Indian population and to evaluate their utility in identifying GDM cases. A case-control study, including 300 pregnant women, was included, and clinical and pathological information was collected. The amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used for genotyping four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely FTO (rs9939609), PPARG2 (rs1801282), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), and TCF7L2 (rs12255372). The odds ratio and confidence interval were determined for each SNP in different genetic models. Further, attributable risk, population penetrance, and relative risk were also calculated. The risk allele A of FTO (rs9939609) poses a two times higher risk of GDM (p = 0.02, OR = 2.5). The CG and GG genotypes of PPARG2 (rs1801282) have half a lower risk of GDM. In SLC30A8 (rs13266634), the recessive model analysis showed a two times higher risk of having GDM, while the recessive model (TT vs. GG + GT) analysis in TCF7L2 (rs12255372) indicates a lower risk of GDM. Finally, the relative risk, population penetrance, and attributable risk for risk allele in all four variants was higher in GDM mothers. All four polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with BMI, HbA1c, and insulin. Our study first time confirmed a significant association with GDM for four variants, FTO, PPARG2, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2, in the North Indian population."

Although the pattern of arterial feeding vessels was extremely rare in our case, the vasculature images obtained using fetal 3D-US were comparable to those obtained using postnatal CT angiography."
38886500,Regulatory network analysis based on integrated miRNA-TF reveals key genes in heart failure.,"The etiology and pathophysiology of heart failure are still unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) expression may be associated with the development of heart failure. Therefore, this study aims to explore key miRNAs, TFs, and related genes in heart failure to gain a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of heart failure. To search and download the dataset of mRNA chips related to heart failure from the GEO database (GSE59867, GSE9128, and GSE134766), we analyzed differential genes and screened the common differentially expressed genes on two chips using R language software. The binary interactions and circuits among miRNAs, TFs, and corresponding genes were determined by Pearson correlation coefficient. A regulatory network of miRNAs, TFs, and target genes was constructed based on bioinformatics. By comparing the sequences of patients with and without heart failure, five downregulated genes with hypermethylated mRNA and three upregulated genes with hypomethylated mRNA were identified. The miRNA-TF gene regulatory network consisted of 26 miRNAs, 22 TFs and six genes. GO and KEGG analysis results revealed that BP terms like cellular response to organic substance, cellular response to cytokine stimulus, and KEGG pathways like osteoclast differentiation, MAPK signaling pathway, and legionellosis were enriched of the DEGs. TMEM87A, PPP2R2A, DUSP1, and miR-92a have great potential as biomarkers for heart failure. The integrated analysis of the mRNA expression spectrum and microRNA-transcription factor-gene revealed the regulatory network of heart failure, which may provide clues to its alternative treatment."
38886407,Multivariate testing and effect size measures for batch effect evaluation in radiomic features.,"While precision medicine applications of radiomics analysis are promising, differences in image acquisition can cause ""batch effects"" that reduce reproducibility and affect downstream predictive analyses. Harmonization methods such as ComBat have been developed to correct these effects, but evaluation methods for quantifying batch effects are inconsistent. In this study, we propose the use of the multivariate statistical test PERMANOVA and the Robust Effect Size Index (RESI) to better quantify and characterize batch effects in radiomics data. We evaluate these methods in both simulated and real radiomics features extracted from full-field digital mammography (FFDM) data. PERMANOVA demonstrated higher power than standard univariate statistical testing, and RESI was able to interpretably quantify the effect size of site at extremely large sample sizes. These methods show promise as more powerful and interpretable methods for the detection and quantification of batch effects in radiomics studies."
38887983,Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen-Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide-Releasing Photosensitizers.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)-releasing moieties, namely ZnPc-2NO and ZnPc-4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor protein HIF-1α. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen-dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc-2NO elicits the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen-economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments."

38887549,The impact of abstinence from chronic alcohol consumption on the mouse striatal proteome: sex and subregion-specific differences.,"Alcohol misuse is the third leading preventable cause of death in the world. The World Health Organization currently estimates that 1 in 20 deaths are directly alcohol related. One of the ways in which consuming excessive levels of alcohol can both directly and indirectly affect human mortality and morbidity, is through chronic inflammation. Recently, studies have suggested a link between increased alcohol use and the incidence of neuroinflammatory-related diseases. However, the mechanism in which alcohol potentially influences neuroinflammatory processes is still being uncovered. We implemented an unbiased proteomics exploration of alcohol-induced changes in the striatum, with a specific emphasis on proteins related to inflammation. The striatum is a brain region that is critically involved with the progression of alcohol use disorder. Using mass spectrometry following voluntary alcohol self-administration in mice, we show that distinct protein abundances and signaling pathways in different subregions of the striatum are disrupted by chronic exposure to alcohol compared to water drinking control mice. Further, in mice that were allowed to experience abstinence from alcohol compared to mice that were non-abstinent, the overall proteome and signaling pathways showed additional differences, suggesting that the responses evoked by chronic alcohol exposure are dependent on alcohol use history. To our surprise we did not find that chronic alcohol drinking or abstinence altered protein abundance or pathways associated with inflammation, but rather affected proteins and pathways associated with neurodegeneration and metabolic, cellular organization, protein translation, and molecular transport processes. These outcomes suggest that in this drinking model, alcohol-induced neuroinflammation in the striatum is not a primary outcome controlling altered neurobehavioral function, but these changes are rather mediated by altered striatal neuronal structure and cellular health."
38886590,An algorithmic framework for synthetic cost-aware decision making in molecular design.,"Small molecules exhibiting desirable property profiles are often discovered through an iterative process of designing, synthesizing and testing sets of molecules. The selection of molecules to synthesize from all possible candidates is a complex decision-making process that typically relies on expert chemist intuition. Here we propose a quantitative decision-making framework, SPARROW, that prioritizes molecules for evaluation by balancing expected information gain and synthetic cost. SPARROW integrates molecular design, property prediction and retrosynthetic planning to balance the utility of testing a molecule with the cost of batch synthesis. We demonstrate, through three case studies, that the developed algorithm captures the non-additive costs inherent to batch synthesis, leverages common reaction steps and intermediates, and scales to hundreds of molecules."
38886956,Enhancement of motor functional recovery in thoracic spinal cord injury: voluntary wheel running versus forced treadmill exercise.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202503000-00028/figure1/v/2024-06-17T092413Z/r/image-tiff Spinal cord injury necessitates effective rehabilitation strategies, with exercise therapies showing promise in promoting recovery. This study investigated the impact of rehabilitation exercise on functional recovery and morphological changes following thoracic contusive spinal cord injury. After a 7-day recovery period after spinal cord injury, mice were assigned to either a trained group (10 weeks of voluntary running wheel or forced treadmill exercise) or an untrained group. Bi-weekly assessments revealed that the exercise-trained group, particularly the voluntary wheel exercise subgroup, displayed significantly improved locomotor recovery, more plasticity of dopaminergic and serotonin modulation compared with the untrained group. Additionally, exercise interventions led to gait pattern restoration and enhanced transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials. Despite consistent injury areas across groups, exercise training promoted terminal innervation of descending axons. In summary, voluntary wheel exercise shows promise for enhancing outcomes after thoracic contusive spinal cord injury, emphasizing the role of exercise modality in promoting recovery and morphological changes in spinal cord injuries. Our findings will influence future strategies for rehabilitation exercises, restoring functional movement after spinal cord injury."
38887569,Sustainable tandem acylation/Diels-Alder reaction toward versatile tricyclic epoxyisoindole-7-carboxylic acids in renewable green solvents.,"Tandem Diels-Alder reactions are often used for the straightforward formation of complex natural compounds and the fused polycyclic systems contained in their precursors. In the second step of this reaction, regio- and stereochemically controlled intramolecular cyclization leads to the formation of versatile nitrogen-containing tricyclic systems. However, these useful organic transformations are usually carried out in highly toxic organic solvents such as benzene, toluene, chloroform, etc. Despite recent efforts by 'green chemists', synthetic chemists still use these traditional toxic organic solvents in many of their reactions, even though safer alternatives are available. However, in addition to the harmful effects of these petrochemical solvents on the environment, the prediction that their resources will run out in the near future has led 'green chemists' to explore solvents that can be derived from renewable resources and used effectively in various organic transformations. In this context, we have shown for the first time that the 100% atom-economical tandem Diels-Alder reaction between aminofuranes and maleic anhydride can be carried out successfully in vegetable oils and waxes. The reaction was successfully carried out in sunflower seed oil, olive oil, oleic acid and lauryl myristate under mild reaction conditions. A series of epoxyisoindole-7-carboxylic acid and bisepoxyisoindole-7-carboxylic acids were obtained in good yields after a practical isolation procedure. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the potential of vegetable oils and their renewable materials to provide a reaction medium that is more sustainable than conventional organic solvents in cascade Diels-Alder reactions and can be used repeatedly without significant degradation. These materials also allow the reaction to be completed in less time, with less energy consumption and higher yields."

38887990,From Bone Remodeling to Wound Healing: An miR-146a-5p-Loaded Nanocarrier Targets Endothelial Cells to Promote Angiogenesis.,"Wound healing is a complex challenge that demands urgent attention in the clinical realm. Efficient angiogenesis is a pivotal factor in promoting wound healing. microRNA-146a (miR-146a) inhibitor has angiogenic potential in the periodontal ligament. However, free microRNAs (miRNAs) are poorly delivered into cells due to their limited tissue specificity and low intracellular delivery efficiency. To address this hurdle, we developed a nanocarrier for targeted delivery of the miR-146a inhibitor into endothelial cells. It is composed of a polyethylenimine (PEI)-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) core and a pentapeptide (YIGSR) layer that recognizes endothelial cells. In vitro, we defined that the miR-146a inhibitor and adiponectin (ADP) can modulate angiogenesis and the remodeling of periodontal tissues by activating the ERK and Akt signaling pathways. Then, we confirm the specificity of YIGSR to endothelial cells, and importantly, the nanocarrier effectively delivers the miR-146a inhibitor into endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis. In a C57 mouse skin wound model, the miR-146a inhibitor is successfully delivered into endothelial cells at the wound site using the nanocarrier, resulting in the formation of new blood vessels with strong CD31 expression. Additionally, no significant differences are found in the expression levels of inflammatory markers interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. This outcome not only brings new strategies for angiogenesis but also exhibits broader implications for bone remodeling and wound healing. The breakthrough holds significance for future research and clinical interventions."
38885867,Synthesis of bimetallic oxides (SrO-CoO) nanoparticles decorated polyacrylamide hydrogels for controlled drug release and wound healing applications.,"Hydrogels are polymeric structures characterized by their three-dimensional nature, insolubility in aqueous media, and remarkable ability to absorb significant amounts of water. Owing to their exceptional biocompatibility with living tissues, hydrogels find extensive use in various biomedical applications. Guggul gum grafted polyacrylamide hydrogels (SG) were prepared and green synthesized SrO, CoO and SrO-CoO nanoparticles (NPs) were incorporated with hydrogels (SrG, CoG, Sr-CoG) respectively. The fabricated hydrogels were characterized by various analytical techniques such as FTIR, XRD and SEM. XRD results confirmed the presence of Sr and Co metal nanoparticles in the fabricated hydrogels matrix, SrG pattern showed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30°, 36.59°, 44.11°, 50.22° and 62.20° while CoG peaks appeared at 2θ = 36.59°, 42.32°, 61.18°, 74.05° and 77.08°. SG, SrG, CoG and Sr-CoG hydrogels showed 11 %, 32 %, 23 % and 45 % radical scavenging activity respectively as compared to standard BHT (Butylated hydroxyl toluene). In vitro drug release tests results showed that SG, SrG, CoG and Sr-CoG exhibited 21 %, 16 %, 13 % and 10 % sustained release of naproxen respectively. The results revealed that SrO and CoO nanoparticles dopped hydrogels possessed good wound healing potential as compared to conventional hydrogels, which provides great potential in clinical treatment for wounds."
38887568,Phenotellurazine redox catalysts: elements of design for radical cross-dehydrogenative coupling reactions.,"Redox active phenotellurazine catalysts have been recently utilized in two different cross-dehydrogenative coupling reactions. In this study, we revisit the design of the phenotellurazine redox catalysts. In particular, we investigate the level of cooperativity between the Te- and N-centers, the effect of secondary versus tertiary N-centers, the effect of heterocyclic versus non-heterocyclic structures, and the effect of substitution patterns on the redox catalytic activity."
38885907,Developing an orbitally shaken bioreactor featuring a square vessel wall with a large circular chamfer.,"The impact of orbitally shaking bioreactors (OSRs) on the biopharmaceutical industry is becoming increasingly important. In the preliminary exploration of the orbitally shaking bioreactor performance, the vessel wall shape has a crucial influence on the mixing and mass transfer in the bioreactor. However, the shape of OSRs still maintains a cylindrical structure, significantly limiting the advantages of the orbital shaking mixing. Therefore, in order to further improve the mixing and mass transfer performance of OSRs, a novel wall shape is proposed in this paper. This novel wall shape consists of cylindrical and square parts and looks like a square tank with a large circular chamfer (STCC), which was found could effectively enhance the efficiency of material mixing and mass transfer theoretically. Based on the same specific volumetric power consumption, a comparative analysis was conducted on the mixing time and oxygen transfer efficiency of OSRs with different shape walls using simulation and experimental methods. The results showed that the OSR with STCC was expected to perform higher mixing and oxygen transfer efficiency than the OSR with cylindrical wall. These findings suggested a promising prospect for the future application of the OSRs with STCC."
38888008,Acute Exercise Improves Large-Scale Brain Network Segregation in Healthy Older Adults.,"Age-related cognitive decline and mental health problems are accompanied by changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) indices, such as reduced brain network segregation. Meanwhile, exercise can improve cognition, mood, and neural network function in older adults. Studies on effects of exercise on rsFC outcomes in older adults have chiefly focused on changes after exercise training and suggest improved network segregation via enhanced within-network connectivity. However, effects of acute exercise on rsFC measures of neural network integrity in older adults, which presumably underlie changes observed after exercise training, have received less attention. Here, we hypothesized that acute exercise in older adults would improve functional segregation of major cognition and affect-related brain networks. To test this, we analyzed rsFC data from 37 healthy and physically active older adults after they completed 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity cycling and after they completed a seated rest control condition. Conditions were performed in a counterbalanced order across separate days in a within-subject crossover design. We considered large-scale brain networks associated with cognition and affect including the frontoparietal (FPN), salience (SAL), default mode (DMN), and affect-reward (ARN) networks. We observed that after acute exercise, there was greater segregation between SAL and DMN, as well as greater segregation between SAL and ARN. These findings indicate that acute exercise in active older adults alters rsFC measures in key cognition and affect-related networks in a manner that opposes age-related dedifferentiation of neural networks that may be detrimental to cognition and mental health."
38885960,Overview of crosstalk between stromal and epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis and shared features with deep endometriotic nodules.,"Since the first description of adenomyosis more than 150 years ago, multiple hypotheses have attempted to explain its pathogenesis. Indeed, research over recent years has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the underlying causes. This has opened up avenues for the development of strategies for both disease prevention and treatment of its main symptoms, such as pelvic pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and infertility. However, the current means are still largely ineffective, so it is vital that we shed light on the pathways involved. Dysregulated mechanisms and aberrant protein expression have been identified as contributing factors in interactions between endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, ultimately leading to the growth of adenomyotic lesions. These include collective cell migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, hormonal influence, and signaling from non-coding RNAs and extracellular vesicles. We provide a concise summary of the latest insights into the crosstalk between glands and stroma in ectopic adenomyotic lesion formation. While there is an abundance of literature on similarities between adenomyosis and deep endometriosis, there are insufficient data on the cytochemical, molecular, and pathogenetic mechanisms of these two disorders. However, various shared features, including alterations of cell adhesion molecules, abnormal hormone regulation, and the presence of cancer-driving mutations and epigenetic modifications, have been identified. Nevertheless, the pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to the cause and development of these enigmatic diseases have not been fully elucidated yet."
38887179,Seventeen years since rimonabant's downfall: reassessing its suicidality risk profile.,"Targeting the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) is a clinically validated antiobesity therapeutic approach. The only such drug approved, rimonabant, was launched in 2006 in Europe but subsequently rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007. The FDA cited the increased risk of suicidality in its opposition to rimonabant's approval, leading to the drug's eventual worldwide withdrawal and the abandonment of this class of therapeutics. Seventeen years later, a new class of CB1-targeting drugs is emerging, but the impact of the 2007 FDA decision remains a formidable obstacle to its clinical development. We revisit the suicidality data presented by the FDA in light of the evolution of suicidality assessment and cross-reference this with the data in the subsequently published clinical trials. We conclude that the publicly available data do not support the FDA's conclusion that the use of rimonabant was associated with an increase in the risk of suicidality."
38887925,"A cotton mitochondrial alternative electron transporter, GhD2HGDH, induces early flowering by modulating GA and photoperiodic pathways.","D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme containing flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD, existing as a dimer, and it facilitates the specific oxidation of D-2HG to 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), which is a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. A Genome-wide expression analysis (GWEA) has indicated an association between GhD2HGDH and flowering time. To further explore the role of GhD2HGDH, we performed a comprehensive investigation encompassing phenotyping, physiology, metabolomics, and transcriptomics in Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing GhD2HGDH. Transcriptomic and qRT-PCR data exhibited heightened expression of GhD2HGDH in upland cotton flowers. Additionally, early-maturing cotton exhibited higher expression of GhD2HGDH across all tissues than delayed-maturing cotton. Subcellular localization confirmed its presence in the mitochondria. Overexpression of GhD2HGDH in Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we investigated the impact of GhD2HGDH on flowering in both early- and delayed-maturing cotton plants. Manipulation of GhD2HGDH expression levels led to changes in photosynthetic pigment and gas exchange attributes. GhD2HGDH responded to gibberellin (GA3) hormone treatment, influencing the expression of GA biosynthesis genes and repressing DELLA genes. Protein interaction studies, including yeast two-hybrid, luciferase complementation (LUC), and GST pull-down assays, confirmed the interaction between GhD2HGDH and GhSOX (Sulfite oxidase). The metabolomics analysis demonstrated GhD2HGDH's modulation of the TCA cycle through alterations in various metabolite levels. Transcriptome data revealed that GhD2HGDH overexpression triggers early flowering by modulating the GA3 and photoperiodic pathways of the flowering core factor genes. Taken together, GhD2HGDH positively regulates the network of genes associated with early flowering pathways."

One of the barriers to good vision following keratoplasty is residual post operative surgical astigmatism. Following a thorough literature search, we present the different options available to readers, with regards to how post-operative astigmatism can be approached and managed in order to improve vision. We present available data from the literature, which in some areas are scarce, with a view to collating all of this information in one place, allowing comparison between different modalities of treatment."
38887863,Impact of the educational setting on the teaching and learning of the equine distal limb ultrasonography.,"The use of immersive methodologies is a trend in the educational environment, but their outcomes in the teaching-learning process need to be better understood. This study aimed to assess the impact of the educational environment on learning equine distal limb ultrasonography, comparing immersive classroom, traditional classroom, and virtual classroom. A total of 153 veterinary medicine students from the first to the third semester participated in this study. The students were divided into four groups: traditional (n = 22), immersive (n = 100), online (n = 31), and traditional-immersive (n = 15). The students completed a questionnaire before and immediately after the class. The online group had a lower average gain in correct answers compared to the others (p < 0.01). Regarding student perception, it was observed that the virtual group had the lowest satisfaction score (p < 0.001), and students in the immersive and online environments were more satisfied with the resources used compared to the traditional classroom (p = 0.01). Concluding, in the present study students showed a greater interest in environments associated with technology, and that in-person modalities resulted in significantly superior learning outcomes compared to online ones."
38885925,Local tetanus begins with a VAMP cleavage-associated neuromuscular junction paralysis around the site of tetanus neurotoxin release.,"Local tetanus develops when limited amounts of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) are released by Clostridium tetani generated from spores inside a necrotic wound. Within days, a spastic paralysis restricted to the muscles of the affected anatomical area develops. This paralysis follows the retrograde transport of TeNT inside the axons of spinal cord motoneurons and its uptake by inhibitory interneurons with cleavage of VAMP, a synaptic vesicle protein required for neurotransmitter release. Consequently, incontrollable excitation of motoneurons causes contractures of innervated muscles and to local spastic paralysis. Here, the initial events occurring close to the site of TeNT release were investigated in a mouse model of local tetanus. A peripheral flaccid paralysis was found to occur, before or overlapping, the spastic one. At variance from the confined TeNT proteolytic activity at the periphery, central VAMP cleavage can be detected within inhibitory interneurons controlling motor neuron efferents innervating muscle groups distant from the site of TeNT release. These results indicate that TeNT does have a peripheral activity in tetanus and explains why the spastic paralysis observed in local tetanus, although confined to single limbs, generally affects multiple muscles. The initial TeNT neuroparalytic activity can be detected by measuring the compound muscle action potential providing a very early diagnosis and therapy thus preventing the ensuing life-threatening generalized tetanus."
38887874,Organisms have gravity: taking an organism-centered approach in experimental biology.,"When you take the time to observe another organism, there is a sort of gravity that can take hold, a mixture of curiosity and connection that expands and strengthens the more you interact with that organism. Yet, in research, a connection with one's study organism can, at times, feel countercultural. Study organisms are sometimes viewed more as tools to conveniently study biological questions. Here, we explicitly highlight the importance of organism-centered research not only in scientific discovery, but also in conservation and in the communication and perception of science."
38887744,Tension-Band Plating for Infantile Blount Disease: Efficacy and Outcomes Comprehensive Review.,"Infantile Blount disease (IBD) is a pathologic varus knee deformity that, if left untreated, can lead to abnormal gait, limb length discrepancy, and pain. Traditionally, bracing and tibial osteotomy have been the primary treatments. More recently, guided growth with tension-band plating (TBP) has gained popularity, although there is a lack of data stratifying between the infantile, juvenile, and adolescent disease types. Therefore, the present review aims to determine the efficacy and complications of TBP in the IBD population. A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies included those focused on guided growth correction for IBD. Studies that did not stratify subjects by subgroup (infantile, juvenile, and adolescent) within their analysis were excluded. The outcomes of interest included demographic information, correction rate, failure rate, recurrence rate, and postoperative complications. Database review identified 541 studies. After screening, seven studies met our inclusion criteria, all of which were retrospective observational studies published between 2012 and 2022. In total, 92 limbs afflicted with Infantile Blount Disease underwent treatment with TBP. The recorded follow-up period ranged from four months to eight years. The age of patients at the time of surgery varied from 1.8 to nine years. On average, there was a 78.99% correction of deformities, with a range of 57.14% to 100%. Six studies provided data on failure and recurrence rates, with an average rate of 23.47%. Notably, infection and hardware failure emerged as the most prevalent postoperative complications, with mean rates of 11.44% and 9.50%, respectively. The average reoperation rate was 29.90%, with a range from 0.00% to 47.06%. The current literature shows a high rate of deformity correction with a relatively low risk of complications after TBP for IBD. Given the reported reoperation rates greatly varied, further data is needed to determine risk factors for reoperation following TBP. Our results suggest that guided growth with TBP may be a preferable first-line treatment for IBD."
38887043,Evaluation of the efficacy of marine natural products against PARP-1/2 proteins in high-grade serous ovarian cancer: insights into MD and SMD simulations.,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most malignant and ubiquitous phenotype of epithelial ovarian cancer. Originating in the fallopian tubes and rapidly spreading to the ovaries, this highly heterogeneous disease is a result of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. The proteins known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) aid in the development of HGSOC by repairing the cancer cells that proliferate and spread metastatically. By using molecular docking to screen 1100 marine natural products (MNPs) from different marine environments against PARP-1/2 proteins, prominent PARP inhibitors (PARPi) were identified. Four compounds, alisiaquinone A, alisiaquinone C, ascomindone D and (+)-zampanolide referred to as MNP-1, MNP-2, MNP-3 and MNP-4, respectively, were chosen based on their binding affinity towards PARP-1/2 proteins, and their bioavailability and drug-like qualities were accessed using ADMET analysis. To investigate the structural stability and dynamics of these complexes, molecular dynamics simulations were performed for 200 ns. These results were compared with the complexes of olaparib (OLA), a PARPi that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. We determined that MNP-4 exhibited stronger binding energies with PARP-1/2 proteins than OLA by using MM/PBSA calculations. Hotspot residues from PARP-1 (E883, M890, Y896, D899 and Y907) and PARP-2 (Y449, F450, A451, S457 and Y460) showed strong interactions with the compounds. To comprehend the unbinding mechanism of MNP-4 complexed with PARP-1/2, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were performed. We concluded from the free energy landscape (FEL) map that PARP-1/2 are well-stabilised when the compound MNP-4 is bound rather than being pulled away from its binding pockets. This finding provides significant evidence regarding PARPi, which could potentially be employed in the therapeutic treatment of HGSOC.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
38886134,An integrated bioinformatics analysis reveals IRF8 as a critical biomarker for immune infiltration in atherosclerosis advance.,"Atherosclerosis, a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disorder, is a significant global health concern associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, imposing a substantial societal burden. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis and identify potential therapeutic targets. We conducted an integrated bioinformatics analysis using data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell and TISSUE databases obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus, to identify key genes associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. Here, IRF8 was found to be a key gene in atherosclerosis patients. Silencing IRF8 with small interfering RNA reduced inflammation in endothelial cells. This suggests IRF8 is a crucial biomarker for immune infiltration in atherosclerosis advance."
38887929,Natural variation in root traits identifies significant SNPs and candidate genes for phosphate deficiency tolerance in Zea mays L.,"Phosphorus (P) is a crucial macronutrient required for normal plant growth. Its effective uptake from the soil is a trait of agronomic importance. Natural variation in maize (339 accessions) root traits, namely root length and number of primary, seminal, and crown roots, root and shoot phosphate (Pi) contents, and root-to-shoot Pi translocation (root: shoot Pi) under normal (control, 40 ppm) and low phosphate (LP, 1 ppm) conditions, were used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK) model of GWAS provided 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 12 relevant candidate genes putatively linked with root Pi, root: shoot Pi, and crown root number (CRN) under LP. The DNA-protein interaction analysis of Zm00001d002842, Zm00001d002837, Zm00001d002843 for root Pi, and Zm00001d044312, Zm00001d045550, Zm00001d025915, Zm00001d044313, Zm00001d051842 for root: shoot Pi, and Zm00001d031561, Zm00001d001803, and Zm00001d001804 for CRN showed the presence of potential binding sites of key transcription factors like MYB62, bZIP11, ARF4, ARF7, ARF10 and ARF16 known for induction/suppression of phosphate starvation response (PHR). The in-silico RNA-seq analysis revealed up or down-regulation of candidate genes along with key transcription factors of PHR, while Uniprot analysis provided genetic relatedness. Candidate genes that may play a role in P uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation under LP are proposed using common PHR signaling components like MYB62, ARF4, ARF7, ARF10, ARF16, and bZIP11 to induce changes in root growth in maize. Candidate genes may be used to improve low P tolerance in maize using the CRISPR strategy."
38887967,Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched α-Aryl Amides.,"The radical Truce-Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non-expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce-Smiles rearrangement of α-substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom-transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C-H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7:1 to >98:2 d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry-determining step."

38886538,High pulse wave velocity is associated with enlarged perivascular spaces in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Previous studies have demonstrated associations between enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. However, an association between EPVS and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has not yet been clarified. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of our prospective study cohort of 109 participants (16 with DLB). We assessed cognitive function, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and brain magnetic resonance imaging features. The relationships between EPVS and DLB were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Compared with the non-dementia group, the DLB group was more likely to have EPVS in the basal ganglia. Compared with participants without EPVS, those with EPVS were older and had cognitive impairment and high PWV. In multivariable analyses, EPVS in the basal ganglia was independently associated with DLB. High PWV was also independently associated with EPVS in both the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale. High PWV may cause cerebrovascular pulsatility, leading to accelerated EPVS in DLB participants."
38886940,Role of copper chelating agents: between old applications and new perspectives in neuroscience.,"The role of copper element has been an increasingly relevant topic in recent years in the fields of human and animal health, for both the study of new drugs and innovative food and feed supplements. This metal plays an important role in the central nervous system, where it is associated with glutamatergic signaling, and it is widely involved in inflammatory processes. Thus, diseases involving copper (II) dyshomeostasis often have neurological symptoms, as exemplified by Alzheimer's and other diseases (such as Parkinson's and Wilson's diseases). Moreover, imbalanced copper ion concentrations have also been associated with diabetes and certain types of cancer, including glioma. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive overview of recent results that show the importance of these metal ions in several pathologies, mainly Alzheimer's disease, through the lens of the development and use of copper chelators as research compounds and potential therapeutics if included in multi-target hybrid drugs. Seeing how copper homeostasis is important for the well-being of animals as well as humans, we shortly describe the state of the art regarding the effects of copper and its chelators in agriculture, livestock rearing, and aquaculture, as ingredients for the formulation of feed supplements as well as to prevent the effects of pollution on animal productions."
38887272,Hypothyroidism and metabolic cardiovascular disease.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, representing a major health issue of social and economic relevance. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are very common in the adult population, and both disorders may contribute to the onset and progression of CVD. After a brief description of the role of thyroid hormones (THs) on the physiology of the cardiovascular system and the potential mechanism that links THs alterations with changes in cardiac function, blood pressure, endothelial function, and lipid levels, we review updated data about the clinical impact of overt hypothyroidism (OH) and subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) on CV risk, CVD, and mortality. Furthermore, we summarize the current evidence for treating SCH with levothyroxine (L-T4). Several guidelines of distinguished endocrine societies recommend treatment for SCH with TSH higher than 10 mIU/L, where the benefit of L-T4 therapy is more evident for younger people, but still controversial in those aged over 65 years. Based on current knowledge, more research efforts are needed to better address the clinical management of CV risk and CVD in the elderly affected by SCH."
38886743,Current state of signaling pathways associated with the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) represents a chronic and progressive pulmonary disorder distinguished by a notable mortality rate. Despite the elusive nature of the pathogenic mechanisms, several signaling pathways have been elucidated for their pivotal roles in the progression of this ailment. This manuscript aims to comprehensively review the existing literature on the signaling pathways linked to the pathogenesis of IPF, both within national and international contexts. The objective is to enhance the comprehension of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying IPF and offer a scholarly foundation for the advancement of more efficacious therapeutic strategies, thereby fostering research and clinical practices within this domain."
38887822,Axial Ligand Enables Synthesis of Allenylsilane through Dirhodium(II) Catalysis.,"Described herein is a dirhodium(II)-catalyzed silylation of propargyl esters with hydrosilanes, using tertiary amines as axial ligands. By adopting this strategy, a range of versatile and useful allenylsilanes can be achieved with good yields. This reaction not only represents a SN2'-type silylation of the propargyl derivatives bearing a terminal alkyne moiety to synthesize allenylsilanes from simple hydrosilanes, but also represents a new application of dirhodium(II) complexes in catalytic transformation of carbon-carbon triple bond. The highly functionalized allenylsilanes that are produced can be transformed into a series of synthetically useful organic molecules. In this reaction, an intriguing ON-OFF effect of the amine ligand was observed. The reaction almost did not occur (OFF) without addition of Lewis base amine ligand. However, the reaction took place smoothly (ON) after addition of only catalytic amount of amine ligand. Detailed mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reactivity can be delicately improved by the use of tertiary amine. The fine-tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the formation of the Rh-Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating β-oxygen elimination."

38887644,Au@Ag nanoparticles: an analytical tool to study the effect of tyrosine on dopamine levels.,"The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) plays important roles in the human body, including regulatory functions, movement, memory and motivational control. The direct intake of DA is impossible as it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) efficiently. Notably, l-tyrosine works as a precursor of DA in the human brain. Herein, we report an analytical method that strongly supports the hypothesis that the intake of tyrosine (Tyr)-rich food enhances DA levels. For this analysis, citrate-coated gold-core silver-shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs) were synthesized. The interaction of DA with the Au@Ag NPs was investigated using multiple spectroscopic techniques, and different thermodynamic parameters were evaluated to assign the binding mechanism. Real sample analysis with Tyr-rich food was also conducted to study the effect of Tyr on DA levels. Analytical studies were performed to verify the outcomes of the present work. The limit of detection of the Au@Ag NPs-DA system for Tyr was found to be 1.64 mM. This study can contribute to development in the fields of medicine and pharmaceuticals, particularly in regard to neuromedicine. One of the major advantages of this investigation is that it will fuel research interest in the supplementation of neurotransmitters and help categorize Tyr as a dietary precursor of dopamine."
38887081,Appropriateness of Artificial Intelligence Chatbots in Diabetic Foot Ulcer Management: Reply.,"In response to the commentary by Daungsupawong and Wiwanitkit (doi: 10.1177/15347346241247914), we authored a reply letter addressing their concerns regarding our previous publication (doi: 10.1177/15347346241236811). Daungsupawong and Wiwanitkit highlighted that while the advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots show promise, several challenges remain in their application to diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) management. In our reply, we emphasized the recent improvements in chatbots' capabilities, particularly in image interpretation and non-English language communication. We posit that these challenges will be overcome in the near future, enabling the clinical implementation of AI chatbots for DFU management."
38887134,Real-Time Metabolic Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Pancreatic and Colon Cancer Tumor-Xenografts with Parahydrogen Hyperpolarized 1-13C Pyruvate-d3.,"Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) is an emerging technique to enhance the signal of stable isotope metabolic contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance (MR). The objective of this study is to continue establishing 1-13C-pyruvate-d3, signal-enhanced via PHIP, as a hyperpolarized contrast agent, obtained in seconds, to monitor metabolism in human cancer. Our focus was on human pancreatic and colon tumor xenografts. 1-13C-vinylpyruvate-d6 was hydrogenated using parahydrogen. Thereafter, the polarization of the protons was transferred to 13C. Following a workup procedure, the free hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate-d3 was obtained in clean aqueous solution. After injection into animals bearing either pancreatic or colon cancer xenografts, slice-selective MR spectra were acquired and analyzed to determine rate constants of metabolic conversion into lactate and alanine. 1-13C-pyruvate-d3 proved to follow the increased metabolic rate to lactate and alanine in the tumor xenografts."
38887340,An Interesting Case of Cholangitis.,"Ascariasis is one of the most common parasitic infections in the world. It is mostly asymptomatic; however, rarely when the worms migrate to the biliary tract, they can cause biliary ascariasis. It typically presents with pain abdomen, jaundice, and fever. This case report is about a patient who presented with fever, icterus, breathlessness, loose stools, and altered sensorium but had no abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with biliary ascariasis using ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient was treated with endoscopic sphincterotomy and albendazole. The patient remained stable after 10 days. The absence of abdominal pain highlights the variability of the presentation of biliary ascariasis."
38887002,Mesh migration into esophagogastric junction after laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair; how to prevent it? A case report.,"Although the use of mesh reinforcement during large hiatal hernia repair may reduce the rate of recurrence, various mesh-related complications have been reported. A 65-year-old woman presented with dysphagia. The patient was diagnosed with a large hiatal hernia and treated with laparoscopic fundoplication and Collis gastroplasty with mesh repair. Six months after surgery, the patient presented with dysphagia and vomiting. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed migration of mesh material into the esophagogastric junction. We performed a proximal gastrectomy with mesh removal. The patient was discharged without any postoperative complications. Herein, we encountered a rare case requiring surgical treatment to resolve mesh-induced esophagogastric perforation after hiatal hernia repair. Mesh-associated complications, such as erosion or migration, should be considered as they may be more common than previously reported. Additionally, these complications are currently underscored in clinical practice. Regarding mesh applications, symptoms of mesh-related complications, such as dysphagia, should be carefully monitored for early detection."
38886515,"Layered complexity, reorganisational ability and self-healing mechanisms of heteropolysaccharide solutions.","Heteropolysaccharides are among the most widely distributed compounds in nature, acting as both tissue building blocks and as a source of nutrients. Their physicochemical and biological properties have been studied thoroughly; however, the microstructural properties of heteropolysaccharides are still poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the micro-structural peculiarities of agarose, gum arabic, hyaluronic and alginic acids by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). Herein, attention is paid to layered complexity of the microstructure differentiating surface, under surface, inner, and substrate interface layers. The scale and pattern of the polysaccharide's microstructure depend on the concentration, changing from lamellae to cell-like porous structures. This work provides the insight into micro- and nanoscale mechanisms of self-healing and substrate-induced reorganisation. Thus, investigation of the self-healing mechanism revealed that this diffusion-based process starts from the fibres, turning into lamellae, following by cell-like structures with smaller dimensions. Investigation of the substrate-induced reorganisation ability showed that nano-to-micro (scale) porous substrate causes reorganisation in the interface layer of the studied heteropolysaccharides. This work contributes to understanding the structural peculiarities of heteropolysaccharides by looking at them through a supramolecular, micro-level prism."
38887871,Microglial activation induces nitric oxide signalling and alters protein S-nitrosylation patterns in extracellular vesicles.,"Neuroinflammation is an underlying feature of neurodegenerative conditions, often appearing early in the aetiology of a disease. Microglial activation, a prominent initiator of neuroinflammation, can be induced through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment resulting in expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which produces nitric oxide (NO). NO post-translationally modifies cysteine thiols through S-nitrosylation, which can alter function of the target protein. Furthermore, packaging of these NO-modified proteins into extracellular vesicles (EVs) allows for the exertion of NO signalling in distant locations, resulting in further propagation of the neuroinflammatory phenotype. Despite this, the NO-modified proteome of activated microglial EVs has not been investigated. This study aimed to identify the protein post-translational modifications NO signalling induces in neuroinflammation. EVs isolated from LPS-treated microglia underwent mass spectral surface imaging using time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), in addition to iodolabelling and comparative proteomic analysis to identify post-translation S-nitrosylation modifications. ToF-SIMS imaging successfully identified cysteine thiol side chains modified through NO signalling in the LPS treated microglial-derived EV proteins. In addition, the iodolabelling proteomic analysis revealed that the EVs from LPS-treated microglia carried S-nitrosylated proteins indicative of neuroinflammation. These included known NO-modified proteins and those associated with LPS-induced microglial activation that may play an essential role in neuroinflammatory communication. Together, these results show activated microglia can exert broad NO signalling changes through the selective packaging of EVs during neuroinflammation."
38887986,An in-depth exploration of six decades of the Kröhnke pyridine synthesis - a review.,"The Kröhnke Pyridine Synthesis has been discovered about six decades ago (1961), by Fritz Kröhnke and Wilfried Zecher at the University of Giessen. The original method involved the reaction of α-pyridinium methyl ketone salts with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of a nitrogen source, frequently ammonium acetate. Since its discovery, the Kröhnke methodology has been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-pyridines, with important applications in several research fields. Over the years, a number of modifications to the original approach have been developed and reported, enabling for the broad applicability of these methods even in modern days, also for the synthesis of non-pyridine compounds. In this critical and tutorial review, we will thoroughly explore and discuss the potential of the original method, the refinements that have been made over the years, as well as some applications arising from each type of pyridine and/or non-pyridine compounds produced by Kröhnke's approach."
38887642,Post-functionalization of triamino-phenazinium dyes to reach near-infrared emission.,"This study presents the synthesis and characterization of phenazinium dyes with absorption ranging from red to far-red, as well as emission extending into the far-red to near-infrared (NIR) region. The procedure involves the post-functionalization of a triamino-phenazinium that was recently reported as a theranostic agent. The introduction of electron-withdrawing moieties is accomplished through acylation or aromatic nucleophilic substitution. For one of the obtained products, a further substitution step could be achieved with primary amines to tune the electron density of the phenazinium core. The isolated dyes exhibit promising features that hold potential for future applications as biological markers or therapeutic agents."
38887922,The endocrinologist gap: Managing diabetes patients in absence of a specialist.,"The treatment of pediatric patients with diabetes is frequently orchestrated within a multidisciplinary framework at tertiary, specialized institutions. In situations where emergent surgery is indicated or when a procedure is scheduled in a facility devoid of an endocrinology service, the onus of managing perioperative glycemic levels may rest with the attending anesthesiologist. The objective of this review is to furnish a comprehensive examination of the anesthetic considerations and perioperative governance of pediatric patients with diabetes. Furthermore, this paper delineates a streamlined protocol for perioperative glycemic control, tailored to both major and minor surgical interventions."
38887494,Systemic Inflammation Differences in Brain-vs. Circulatory-Dead Donors: Impact on Lung Transplant Recipients.,"Brain death triggers a systemic inflammatory response. Whether systemic inflammation is different in lung donors after brain- (DBD) or circulatory-death (DCD) is unknown, but this may potentially increase the incidence of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation. We compared the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α in BDB and DCD and their respective recipients, as well as their relationship with PGD and mortality after LT. A prospective, observational, multicenter, comparative, cohort-nested study that included 40 DBD and 40 DCD lung donors matched and their respective recipients. Relevant clinical information and blood samples were collected before/during lung retrieval in donors and before/during/after (24, 48 and 72 h) LT in recipients. Incidence of PGD and short-term mortality after LT was recorded. Plasma levels of all determined cytokines were numerically higher in DBD than in DCD donors and reached statistical significance for IL-6, IL-10 and IL-8. In recipients with PGD the donor's plasma levels of TNF-α were higher. The post-operative mortality rate was very low and similar in both groups. DBD is associated with higher systemic inflammation than DCD donors, and higher TNF-α plasma levels in donors are associated with a higher incidence of PGD."
38885889,How does Nogo-A signalling influence mitochondrial function during multiple sclerosis pathogenesis?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severe neurological disorder that involves inflammation in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve with key disabling neuropathological outcomes being axonal damage and demyelination. When degeneration of the axo-glial union occurs, a consequence of inflammatory damage to central nervous system (CNS) myelin, dystrophy and death can lead to large membranous structures from dead oligodendrocytes and degenerative myelin deposited in the extracellular milieu. For the first time, this review covers mitochondrial mechanisms that maybe operative during MS-related neurodegenerative changes directly activated during accumulating extracellular deposits of myelin associated inhibitory factors (MAIFs), that include the potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth, Nogo-A. Axonal damage may occur when Nogo-A binds to and signals through its cognate receptor, NgR1, multimeric complex, to initially stall axonal transport and limit the delivery of important growth-dependent cargo and subcellular organelles such as mitochondria for metabolic efficiency at sites of axo-glial disintegration as a consequence of inflammation. Metabolic efficiency in axons fails during active demyelination and progressive neurodegeneration, preceded by stalled transport of functional mitochondria to fuel axo-glial integrity."
38886462,Effect of manual OCTA segmentation correction to improve image quality and visibility of choroidal neovascularization in AMD.,"In this retrospective case series on neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), we aimed to improve Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) visualization in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) scans by addressing segmentation errors. Out of 198 eyes, 73 OCTA scans required manual segmentation correction. We compared uncorrected scans to those with minimal (2 corrections), moderate (10 corrections), and detailed (50 corrections) efforts targeting falsely segmented Bruch's Membrane (BM). Results showed that 55% of corrected OCTAs exhibited improved quality after manual correction. Notably, minimal correction (2 scans) already led to significant improvements, with additional corrections (10 or 50) not further enhancing expert grading. Reduced background noise and improved CNV identification were observed, with the most substantial improvement after two corrections compared to baseline uncorrected images. In conclusion, our approach of correcting segmentation errors effectively enhances image quality in OCTA scans of nAMD. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the method, with 55% of resegmented OCTA images exhibiting enhanced quality, leading to a notable increase in the proportion of high-quality images from 63 to 83%."
38885965,The role of metabolic and bariatric surgery on the obesity pandemic in Latin America: A review of current practices and future directions.,"Latin America faces a significant public health challenge due to the high prevalence of obesity and its associated diseases. Metabolic and bariatric surgery is effective and safe to treat obesity when other treatments fail; however, its implementation in Latin America remains unsatisfactory. This review explores the current status, challenges, and innovations of metabolic and bariatric surgery in Latin America. We searched peer-reviewed journals in English and Spanish for relevant articles published between 1998 and 2023. We found that more than 20% of the Latin American population is affected by obesity. Unfortunately, only a limited number of patients have access to metabolic and bariatric surgery due to high cost, limited availability, and shortage of specialists. The review found that ongoing clinical trials are being conducted in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela, indicating some regional progress. However, published studies remain low in number compared with other regions. Furthermore, we summarized the clinical outcomes, risks, and perioperative assessments associated with metabolic and bariatric surgery. We discussed potential strategies to enhance the availability and affordability of this intervention. This review emphasizes the significance of metabolic and bariatric surgery in addressing the obesity pandemic, specifically for Latin America, and proposes directions for future research and innovation."
38887752,A Case of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis After Hyperprogression in Human Papillomavirus-Positive (HPV+) Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Immunotherapy has been shown to provide clinical benefit in selected patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), regardless of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and including recurrent/metastatic (R/M) platinum refractory tumors. Hyperprogression is an uncommon negative outcome of treatment with immunotherapy. We present the case of a patient with HPV+ HNSCC who presented hyperprogression after immunotherapy and a rare metastasis location with peritoneal carcinomatosis and subcutaneous nodules. HPV+ HNSCC is related to distant recurrence after a longer interval of time and more diverse metastasis sites compared with HPV- disease. However, the literature on peritoneal metastasis in HNSCC remains limited, with few documented cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting peritoneal carcinomatosis after hyperprogression in HNSCC."
38887332,Shifting the Scales: Tirzepatide's Breakthrough in Obesity Management.,"Obesity is a complex and chronic condition that presents a significant global health challenge, resulting in a wide range of health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, therefore diminishing the overall well-being of numerous individuals. Conventional treatment options often prove inadequate, providing temporary relief and frequent weight regain. However, a promising medication called tirzepatide has emerged and been approved by the FDA as a groundbreaking solution for managing obesity. Through its unique mechanism of action as a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, as well as its impressive results in clinical trials, tirzepatide has the potential to completely transform the current approach to treating obesity. This editorial provides a quick snap for the clinical implications of tirzepatide, its mechanism of action, effectiveness, safety record, and the challenges it faces, such as insurance coverage and drug shortages. It emphasizes the importance of an integrated treatment approach and highlights the necessity for continuous research and policy backing to enhance accessibility and advance public health outcomes related to weight management."
38887339,From Protection to Prevention: Redefining Vaccines in the Context of Antimicrobial Resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health, compromising the effectiveness of treatments and increasing medical risks. In this crisis, the importance of vaccines in reducing AMR is being increasingly acknowledged, although not thoroughly explored. This literature review asserts that vaccines can significantly lessen the occurrence of infections, thereby reducing the need for antibiotics and limiting the emergence of resistance. Vaccines play a crucial role in antimicrobial stewardship programs by preventing diseases that would otherwise necessitate the use of antibiotics. Expanding vaccine coverage supports responsible usage of antimicrobials and aligns with global health priorities to maintain effective medical interventions. This review emphasizes the need for equitable funding and policy support for vaccine initiatives comparable to new antibiotics and diagnostic techniques. Moreover, it calls for more detailed investigations into vaccines' economic and health benefits in managing AMR, highlighting their potential as cost-effective solutions to this urgent health challenge. Through a careful analysis of existing literature, this review highlights the fundamental role of vaccines in transforming the landscape of AMR, shifting the focus from a protective approach to a preventive health strategy."
38886936,Liver as a new target organ in Alzheimer's disease: insight from cholesterol metabolism and its role in amyloid-beta clearance.,"Alzheimer's disease, the primary cause of dementia, is characterized by neuropathologies, such as amyloid plaques, synaptic and neuronal degeneration, and neurofibrillary tangles. Although amyloid plaques are the primary characteristic of Alzheimer's disease in the central nervous system and peripheral organs, targeting amyloid-beta clearance in the central nervous system has shown limited clinical efficacy in Alzheimer's disease treatment. Metabolic abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The liver is the primary peripheral organ involved in amyloid-beta metabolism, playing a crucial role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Notably, impaired cholesterol metabolism in the liver may exacerbate the development of Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we explore the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease and elucidate the role of the liver in amyloid-beta clearance and cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, we propose that restoring normal cholesterol metabolism in the liver could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing Alzheimer's disease."
38887753,Acute Lung Injury and the NLRP3 Inflammasome.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) manifests through harm to the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, arising from a multitude of factors, leading to scattered interstitial alterations, pulmonary edema, and subsequent acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. Acute lung injury (ALI), along with its more serious counterpart, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), carry a fatality rate that hovers around 30-40%. Its principal pathological characteristic lies in the unchecked inflammatory reaction. Currently, the main strategies for treating ALI are alleviation of inflammation and prevention of respiratory failure. Concerning the etiology of ALI, NLRP3 Inflammasome is essential to the body's innate immune response. The composition of this inflammasome complex includes NLRP3, the pyroptosis mediator ASC, and pro-caspase-1. Recent research has reported that the inflammatory response centered on NLRP3 inflammasomes plays a key part in inflammation in ALI, and may hence be a prospective candidate for therapeutic intervention. In the review, we present an overview of the ailment characteristics of acute lung injury along with the constitution and operation of the NLRP3 inflammasome within this framework. We also explore therapeutic strategies targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome to combat acute lung injury."
38887120,Rejection of the status quo: Conspiracy theories and preference for alternative political systems.,"Conspiracy theories introduce a democratic paradox, as belief in conspiracy theories predicts support for both democratic and non-democratic political systems. In this article, we explore whether democratic and anti-democratic attitudes, resulting from conspiracy beliefs, can be mutually exclusive. In Study 1 (United Kingdom, N = 293), we show that belief in conspiracy theories is associated with decreased support for representative democracy, and increased support for direct democracy, anarchism, and autocracy within the same individuals. In Study 2 (United States, N = 302, pre-registered), we experimentally show that the perceived presence of conspiracies is linked to an increased preference for direct democracy, anarchism, and autocracy and decreased support for representative democracy. Mediational analyses suggest that widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo and, less consistently, feelings of political cynicism mediate the relationships between conspiracy beliefs and (anti-)democratic attitudes. In Study 3 (United States, N = 400, pre-registered), we experimentally manipulate (dis)satisfaction with the status quo. Results indicate that rejecting the status quo increases support for direct democracy, anarchism, and autocracy and decreases support for representative democracy. Overall, our findings suggest that people who believe in conspiracy theories tend to favour both democratic and anti-democratic political alternatives, largely attributed to citizens' desire to change the status quo."
38886506,Families as partners in neonatal neuro-critical care programs.,"Parents of neonates with neurologic conditions face a specific breadth of emotional, logistical, and social challenges, including difficulties coping with prognostic uncertainty, the need to make complex medical decisions, and navigating new hopes and fears. These challenges place parents in a vulnerable position and at risk of developing mental health issues, which can interfere with bonding and caring for their neonate, as well as compromise their neonate's long-term neurodevelopment. To optimize neurologic and developmental outcomes, emerging neonatal neuro-critical care (NNCC) programs must concurrently attend to the unique needs of the developing newborn brain and of his/her parents. This can only be accomplished by embracing a family-centered care environment-one which prioritizes effective parent-clinician communication, longitudinal parent support, and parents as equitable partners in clinical care. NNCC programs offer a multifaceted approach to critical care for neonates at-risk for neurodevelopmental impairments, integrating expertise in neonatology and neurology. This review highlights evidence-based strategies to guide NNCC programs in developing a family-partnered approach to care, including primary staffing models; staff communication, implicit bias, and cultural competency trainings; comprehensive and tailored caregiver training; single-family rooms; flexible visitation policies; colocalized neonatal and maternal care; uniform mental health screenings; follow-up care referrals; and connections to peer support. IMPACT: Parents of neonates with neurologic conditions are at high-risk for experiencing mental health issues, which can adversely impact the parent-neonate relationship and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of their neonates. While guidelines to promote families as partners in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have been developed, no protocols integrate the unique needs of parents in neonatal neurologic populations. A holistic approach that makes families true partners in the care of their neonate with a neurologic condition in the NICU has the potential to improve mental and physical well-being for both parents and neonates."
38885945,"Dissecting loci that underpin the genetic correlations between production, fertility, and urea traits in Australian Holstein cattle.","Unfavorable genetic correlations between milk production, fertility, and urea traits have been reported. However, knowledge of the genomic regions associated with these unfavorable correlations is limited. Here, we used the correlation scan method to identify and investigate the regions driving or antagonizing the genetic correlations between production vs. fertility, urea vs. fertility, and urea vs. production traits. Driving regions produce an estimate of correlation that is in the same direction as the global correlation. Antagonizing regions produce an estimate in the opposite direction of the global estimates. Our dataset comprised 6567, 4700, and 12,658 Holstein cattle with records of production traits (milk yield, fat yield, and protein yield), fertility (calving interval) and urea traits (milk urea nitrogen and blood urea nitrogen predicted using milk-mid-infrared spectroscopy), respectively. Several regions across the genome drive the correlations between production, fertility, and urea traits. Antagonizing regions were confined to certain parts of the genome and the genes within these regions were mostly involved in preventing metabolic dysregulation, liver reprogramming, metabolism remodeling, and lipid homeostasis. The driving regions were enriched for QTL related to puberty, milk, and health-related traits. Antagonizing regions were mostly related to muscle development, metabolic body weight, and milk traits. In conclusion, we have identified genomic regions of potential importance for dairy cattle breeding. Future studies could investigate the antagonizing regions as potential genomic regions to break the unfavorable correlations and improve milk production as well as fertility and urea traits."
38887327,Renomedullary Interstitial Cell Tumor in the Background of a Renal Oncocytoma: A Case Report.,"Renomedullary interstitial cell tumors (RMICTs) are rare benign renal tumors that arise from the renal medulla. They are rarely symptomatic and are mostly discovered incidentally. Radiologically, their co-presence ipsilaterally in the background of a larger mass introduces a miscellaneous presentation that raises the suspicion of metastatic disease. A characteristic presentation does not exist. Therefore, an individualized, patient-centered approach should be tailored depending on the nature of the presentation. We report the clinical, radiological, and histopathological presentation of a 46-year-old woman presenting with an RMICT in the background of a renal oncocytoma."
38886400,An experienced racial-ethnic diversity dataset in the United States using human mobility data.,"Despite the importance of measuring racial-ethnic segregation and diversity in the United States, current measurements are largely based on the Census and, thus, only reflect segregation and diversity as understood through residential location. This leaves out the social contexts experienced throughout the course of the day during work, leisure, errands, and other activities. The National Experienced Racial-ethnic Diversity (NERD) dataset provides estimates of diversity for the entire United States at the census tract level based on the range of place and times when people have the opportunity to come into contact with one another. Using anonymized and opted-in mobile phone location data to determine co-locations of people and their demographic backgrounds, these measurements of diversity in potential social interactions are estimated at 38.2 m × 19.1 m scale and 15-minute timeframe for a representative year and aggregated to the Census tract level for purposes of data privacy. As well, we detail some of the characteristics and limitations of the data for potential use in national, comparative studies."
38886357,Study of machine learning techniques for outcome assessment of leptospirosis patients.,"Leptospirosis is a global disease that impacts people worldwide, particularly in humid and tropical regions, and is associated with significant socio-economic deficiencies. Its symptoms are often confused with other syndromes, which can compromise clinical diagnosis and the failure to carry out specific laboratory tests. In this respect, this paper presents a study of three algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest and Adaboost) for predicting the outcome (cure or death) of individuals with leptospirosis. Using the records contained in the government National System of Aggressions and Notification (SINAN, in portuguese) from 2007 to 2017, for the state of Pará, Brazil, where the temporal attributes of health care, symptoms (headache, vomiting, jaundice, calf pain) and clinical evolution (renal failure and respiratory changes) were used. In the performance evaluation of the selected models, it was observed that the Random Forest exhibited an accuracy of 90.81% for the training dataset, considering the attributes of experiment 8, and the Decision Tree presented an accuracy of 74.29 for the validation database. So, this result considers the best attributes pointed out by experiment 10: time first symptoms medical attention, time first symptoms ELISA sample collection, medical attention hospital admission time, headache, calf pain, vomiting, jaundice, renal insufficiency, and respiratory alterations. The contribution of this article is the confirmation that artificial intelligence, using the Decision Tree model algorithm, depicting the best choice as the final model to be used in future data for the prediction of human leptospirosis cases, helping in the diagnosis and course of the disease, aiming to avoid the evolution to death."
38886661,Robust brain tumor classification by fusion of deep learning and channel-wise attention mode approach.,"Diagnosing brain tumors is a complex and time-consuming process that relies heavily on radiologists' expertise and interpretive skills. However, the advent of deep learning methodologies has revolutionized the field, offering more accurate and efficient assessments. Attention-based models have emerged as promising tools, focusing on salient features within complex medical imaging data. However, the precise impact of different attention mechanisms, such as channel-wise, spatial, or combined attention within the Channel-wise Attention Mode (CWAM), for brain tumor classification remains relatively unexplored. This study aims to address this gap by leveraging the power of ResNet101 coupled with CWAM (ResNet101-CWAM) for brain tumor classification. The results show that ResNet101-CWAM surpassed conventional deep learning classification methods like ConvNet, achieving exceptional performance metrics of 99.83% accuracy, 99.21% recall, 99.01% precision, 99.27% F1-score and 99.16% AUC on the same dataset. This enhanced capability holds significant implications for clinical decision-making, as accurate and efficient brain tumor classification is crucial for guiding treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Integrating ResNet101-CWAM into existing brain classification software platforms is a crucial step towards enhancing diagnostic accuracy and streamlining clinical workflows for physicians."
38887102,Persistent unmet need for surgical care in Western Uganda.,"Treatable surgical diseases account for a significant proportion of the global burden of disease, particularly in low- and middle-income communities. The number of deaths owing to poor surgical care or its non-availability has been reported to exceed those from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. The Ugandan government and its development partners aim to put in place measures to achieve universal health coverage for all communities. These include construction and equipping health facilities, training of health workers, opening up road networks, and poverty alleviation programmes. However, these efforts have, as yet, fallen short as evidenced by external hernias remaining the leading cause of intestinal obstruction for more than 40 years. We recommend establishment of global surgery collaborations with rural-based medical training schools and other health facilities, essential surgical skills training for medical students, task shifting in surgical care and integration of regular surgical camps in the Uganda's healthcare delivery model."
38887292,Pancreatic islet transplantation: current advances and challenges.,"Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that traditionally requires severe reliance on medication for treatment. Oral medication and exogenous insulin can only temporarily maintain blood glucose levels and do not cure the disease. Most patients need life-long injections of exogenous insulin. In recent years, advances in islet transplantation have significantly advanced the treatment of diabetes, allowing patients to discontinue exogenous insulin and avoid complications.Long-term follow-up results from recent reports on islet transplantation suggest that they provide significant therapeutic benefit although patients still require immunotherapy, suggesting the importance of future transplantation strategies. Although organ shortage remains the primary obstacle for the development of islet transplantation, new sources of islet cells, such as stem cells and porcine islet cells, have been proposed, and are gradually being incorporated into clinical research. Further research on new transplantation sites, such as the subcutaneous space and mesenteric fat, may eventually replace the traditional portal vein intra-islet cell infusion. Additionally, the immunological rejection reaction in islet transplantation will be resolved through the combined application of immunosuppressant agents, islet encapsulation technology, and the most promising mesenchymal stem cells/regulatory T cell and islet cell combined transplantation cell therapy. This review summarizes the progress achieved in islet transplantation, and discusses the research progress and potential solutions to the challenges faced."
38885864,Comparative study of polycarboxylic acids for sustainable crosslinking of silk fabrics: Evaluating flame retardancy and physical performances.,"For protein fibers, polycarboxylic acids represent a green strategy to enhance durability without using formaldehyde. This study evaluated the physical and flame retardant properties of silk fabrics treated with three formaldehyde-free crosslinkers: citric acid (CA), 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA), and 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA). Results showed that these acids bond with silk protein through esterification and amidation, improving washing durability. Particularly, PBTCA integrates phosphorus into silk, boosting flame retardancy. While BTCA led to the highest weight gain and improved wrinkle recovery, it negatively impacted the tensile strength and softness of silk fabrics. Conversely, PBTCA adeptly balanced enhanced wrinkle resistance with minimal effects on tensile strength and softness, and least affected the silk fabrics' whiteness, thus preserving its aesthetic appeal. All crosslinkers improved flame retardancy, but PBTCA displayed superior performance, achieving a limiting oxygen index of 32.4 % at an 80 g/L concentration. In vertical burning tests, PBTCA treated silk fabrics showed reductions in damage length and demonstrated self-extinguishing properties, qualifying them for a higher flame retardant grade. Phosphorus in PBTCA promotes char formation during combustion, essential for effective flame retardation and smoke reduction. This research highlights the exceptional potential of silk treated with PBTCA, showcasing its suitability for demanding applications."
38885866,Valorization of agro-industrial residues using aspergillus heteromorphus URM0269 for protease production: Characterization and purification.,"This study aimed to produce, characterize and purify a protease from Aspergillus heteromorphus URM0269. After production by solid fermentation of wheat bran performed according to a central composite design, protease was characterized in terms of biochemical, kinetic, and thermodynamic parameters for further purification by chromatography. Proteolytic activity achieved a maximum value of 57.43 U/mL using 7.8 g of wheat bran with 40 % moisture. Protease displayed high stability in the pH and temperature ranges of 5.0-10.0 and 20-30 °C, respectively, and acted optimally at pH 7.0 and 50 °C. The enzyme was characterized as serine protease. The enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with maximum reaction rate 140.0 U/mL and Michaelis constant of 11.6 mg/mL. Thermodynamic activation parameters, namely activation Gibbs free energy (69.79 kJ/mol), enthalpy (5.86 kJ/mol), and entropy (-214.39 J/mol.K) of the hydrolysis reaction, corroborated with kinetic modeling showing high affinity for azocasein. However, thermodynamic parameters suggested a reversible mechanism of unfolding. Purification by chromatography yielded a protease purification factor of 7.2, and SDS-PAGE revealed one protein band with a molecular mass of 14.7 kDa. Circular dichroism demonstrated a secondary structure made up with 45.6 % of α-helices. These results show the great potential of this protease for future use in the industrial area."
38887819,Organic Reactions Enabled by Mechanical Force-Induced Single Electron Transfer.,"Mechanochemical reactions, achieved through milling, grinding, or other mechanical actions, have emerged as a solvent-free alternative to traditional solution-based chemistry. Mechanochemistry not only provides the opportunity to eliminate bulk solvent use, reducing waste generation, but also unveils a new reaction strategy which enables the realization of reactions previously inaccessible in solution. While the majority of organic reactions facilitated by mechanical force traditionally follow two-electron transfer pathways similar to their solution-based counterparts, the field of mechanochemically induced single-electron transfer (SET) reactions has witnessed rapid development. This review outlines examples of mechanochemical reactions facilitated by the SET process, focusing on the reagents that initiate SET, thereby positioning mechanochemistry as a burgeoning field within the realm of single-electron chemistry."
38887374,Advances in salmonid genetics-Insights from Coastwide and beyond.,"This article summarizes the Special Issue of Evolutionary Applications focused on ""Advances in Salmonid Genetics."" Contributions to this Special Issue were primarily presented at the Coastwide Salmonid Genetics Meeting, held in Boise, ID in June 2023, with a focus on Pacific salmonids of the west coast region of North America. Contributions from other regions of the globe are also included and further convey the importance of various salmonid species across the world. This Special Issue is comprised of 22 articles that together illustrate major advances in genetic and genomic tools to address fundamental and applied questions for natural populations of salmonids, ranging from mixed-stock analyses, to conservation of genetic diversity, to adaptation to local environments. These studies provide valuable insight for molecular ecologists since salmonid systems offer a window into evolutionary applications that parallel conservation efforts relevant and applicable beyond salmonid species. Here, we provide an introduction and a synopsis of articles in this Special Issue, along with future directions in this field. We present this Special Issue in honor of Fred Utter, a founder and leader in the field of salmonid genetics, who passed away in 2023."
38886148,The roles of branched-chain amino acids metabolism in tumorigenesis and progression.,"Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including leucine, valine, and isoleucine, play crucial roles in regulating metabolic balance and maintaining physiological functions in the body. Extensive studies have been focused on their implications in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence suggests that BCAAs metabolism also plays significant roles in tumorigenesis and progression. In this review, we overview recent progress of the study on BCAAs metabolism including its relationship with epigenetic regulation. Particularly, we discuss the metabolic reprogramming and metabolic sensing of BCAAs and its intermediate metabolites in tumor cells and microenvironment to decipher their functions. An enhanced understanding of the roles and mechanism of BCAAs metabolism in tumorigenesis and progression will contribute to development of novel therapeutic strategies against tumor."
38887344,Periocular Desmoplastic Malignant Melanoma and Orbital Invasion With Uncontrollable Disease: A Case Report.,"Primary orbital melanoma and metastatic cutaneous melanoma of the orbit are extremely rare. Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is an infrequent variant of melanoma that can extend from a superficial location into deep tissues by neurotropic mechanisms. A 78-year-old male was referred to us with a periocular mixed malignant melanoma (spindle cell melanoma with desmoplastic reaction) in his left lower eyelid with uncontrollable disease (orbital and inferior orbital rim invasion) despite treatment. The surgical technique consisted of an extended orbital exenteration, maxillectomy, and ethmoidectomy, with a 2 cm macroscopic surgical margin. We performed a delayed socket reconstruction with a temporalis muscle flap using a transorbital approach. The patient remained disease-free for 1.5 years with a good quality of life since exenteration surgery. At this time, he presented a recurrence in the area of the malar scar with a new orbital invasion, and finally, he died due to mediastinal, pleural, and pulmonary metastasis. The treatment of a cutaneous melanoma arising in the periocular region is a challenging reconstructive problem and it may compromise the globe and visual function."
38887342,The Neurological Implications of COVID-19: A Comprehensive Narrative Review.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 revealed a huge number of problems as well as discoveries in medicine, notably, regarding the effects of the virus on the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). This paper is a narrative review that takes a deep dive into the complex interactions between COVID-19 and the NS. Therefore, this paper explains the broad range of neurological manifestations and neurodegenerative diseases caused by the virus. It carefully considers the routes through which SARS-CoV-2 reaches the NS, including the olfactory system and of course, the hematogenous route, which are also covered when discussing the virus's direct and indirect mechanisms of neuropathogenesis. Besides neurological pathologies such as stroke, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, the focus area is also given to the challenges of making diagnosis, treatment, and management of these conditions during the pandemic. The review also examines the strategic and interventional approaches utilized to prevent these disorders, as well as the ACE2 receptors implicated in the mediation of neurological effects caused by COVID-19. This detailed overview, which combines research outputs with case data, is directed at tackling this pandemic challenge, with a view toward better patient care and outcomes in the future."
38886204,BCN20000: Dermoscopic Lesions in the Wild.,"Advancements in dermatological artificial intelligence research require high-quality and comprehensive datasets that mirror real-world clinical scenarios. We introduce a collection of 18,946 dermoscopic images spanning from 2010 to 2016, collated at the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona, Spain. The BCN20000 dataset aims to address the problem of unconstrained classification of dermoscopic images of skin cancer, including lesions in hard-to-diagnose locations such as those found in nails and mucosa, large lesions which do not fit in the aperture of the dermoscopy device, and hypo-pigmented lesions. Our dataset covers eight key diagnostic categories in dermoscopy, providing a diverse range of lesions for artificial intelligence model training. Furthermore, a ninth out-of-distribution (OOD) class is also present on the test set, comprised of lesions which could not be distinctively classified as any of the others. By providing a comprehensive collection of varied images, BCN20000 helps bridge the gap between the training data for machine learning models and the day-to-day practice of medical practitioners. Additionally, we present a set of baseline classifiers based on state-of-the-art neural networks, which can be extended by other researchers for further experimentation."
38886182,"Associations with other cancer-related biomarkers might contribute to poor outcomes in RAS-altered, younger patients with colorectal cancer.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer in younger adults. In patients undergoing liver resection with RAS-altered CRCs, there is evidence suggesting younger patients have worse outcomes than older patients. To explain this pattern, differences in associations between RAS status and other cancer-related biomarkers in tumors from younger versus older patients with CRC were evaluated in a cohort of 925 patients with CRC, 277 (30.0%) of whom were ≤50 years old, and 454 (49.1%) who had RAS-altered tumors. For 3 biomarkers, RNF43, APC, and microsatellite instability (MSI), the association with RAS status was significantly modified by age after adjustment for multiple testing. Specifically, younger patients with RAS-altered tumors were more likely to be MSI-high, RNF43 mutated, and APC wild type. These differences might contribute to the observed pattern of diminished survival in younger versus older patients with CRC with RAS-mutated tumors undergoing liver metastasis resection."
38885835,The future of targeted therapy in chronic spontaneous urticaria.,"Chronic urticaria can be divided into two subsets: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with skin lesions occurring without a specific trigger and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) which has an identified specific stimulus. The annual prevalence of CU is 0.5% to 2.3% globally. CSU is a self-limited disorder in most cases, with an average duration of 2 to 5 years, but symptoms persist beyond five years in up to 30% of patients. The first line of treatment is a daily non-sedating, second-generation H1- antihistamines. CSU guidelines recommend using oral non-sedating antihistamines up to 4-fold in patients with CSU unresponsive to standard doses as the next step in treatment. A meta-analysis found that the rate of response in patients with CSU who responded to up-dosing was 63.2%. Therefore, approximately 40% of patients continue to have persistent hives and itching requiring treatment with the biologic omalizumab based on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Although omalizumab has been shown to markedly improve symptoms of CSU, omalizumab is not effective in all patients and has not been shown to induce long-term disease remission. Thus, there is an unmet need for more effective treatments that can lead to cure or long-term remission. In this review, we will provide an overview of new treatment targets and biologics that are under investigation for the treatment of CSU."
38887492,Exploring the role of brain-derived extracellular vesicles in viral infections: from pathological insights to biomarker potential.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles secreted by all cell types that play a central role in cell-to-cell communication. Since these vesicles serve as vehicles of cellular content (nucleic acids, proteins and lipids) with the potential to cross biological barriers, they represent a novel attractive window into an otherwise inaccessible organ, such as the brain. The composition of EVs is cell-type specific and mirrors the physiological condition of the cell-of-origin. Consequently, during viral infection, EVs undergo significant changes in their content and morphology, thereby reflecting alterations in the cellular state. Here, we briefly summarize the potential of brain-derived EVs as a lens into viral infection in the central nervous system, thereby: 1) uncovering underlying pathophysiological processes at play and 2) serving as liquid biopsies of the brain, representing a non-invasive source of biomarkers for monitoring disease activity. Although translating the potential of EVs from research to diagnosis poses complexities, characterizing brain-derived EVs in the context of viral infections holds promise to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, offering new avenues for managing infectious neurological diseases."
38885913,Autophagy markers LC3 and p62 in aging lumbar motor neurons.,"Autophagy is a ubiquitous process through which damaged cytoplasmic structures are recycled and degraded within cells. Aging can affect autophagy regulation in different steps leading to the accumulation of damaged organelles and proteins, which can contribute to cell dysfunction and death. Motor neuron (MN) loss and sarcopenia are prominent features of neuromuscular aging. Previous studies on phrenic MNs showed increased levels of the autophagy proteins LC3 and p62 in 24 month compared to 6 month old mice, consistent with the onset of diaphragm muscle sarcopenia. In the present study, we hypothesized that aging leads to increased expression of the autophagy markers LC3 and p62 in single lumbar MNs. Expression of LC3 and p62 in lumbar MNs (spinal levels L1-L6) was assessed using immunofluorescence and confocal imaging of male and female mice at 6, 18 and 24 months of age, reflecting 100 %, 90 % and 75 % survival, respectively. A mixed linear model with animal as a random effect was used to compare relative LC3 and p62 expression in choline acetyl transferase-positive MNs across age groups. Expression of LC3 and p62 decreased in the white matter of the lumbar spinal cord with aging, with ~29 % decrease in LC3 and ~ 7 % decrease in p62 expression at 24 months of age compared to 6 months of age. There was no change in LC3 or p62 expression in the gray matter with age. LC3 expression in MNs relative to white matter increased significantly with age, with 150 % increase at 24 months of age compared to 6 months of age. Similarly, p62 expression in MNs relative to white matter increased significantly with age, with ~14 % increase at 24 months of age compared to 6 months of age. No effect of sex or MN pool was observed in LC3 and p62 expression in MNs. Overall, these data suggest autophagy impairment during elongation (increased LC3) and degradation (increased p62) phases with aging in lumbar MNs."
38886587,Calibrated prediction intervals for polygenic scores across diverse contexts.,"Polygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as the tool of choice for genomic prediction in a wide range of fields. We show that PGS performance varies broadly across contexts and biobanks. Contexts such as age, sex and income can impact PGS accuracy with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. Here we introduce an approach (CalPred) that models all contexts jointly to produce prediction intervals that vary across contexts to achieve calibration (include the trait with 90% probability), whereas existing methods are miscalibrated. In analyses of 72 traits across large and diverse biobanks (All of Us and UK Biobank), we find that prediction intervals required adjustment by up to 80% for quantitative traits. For disease traits, PGS-based predictions were miscalibrated across socioeconomic contexts such as annual household income levels, further highlighting the need of accounting for context information in PGS-based prediction across diverse populations."
38886404,Association of intensity and dominance of CEOs' smiles with corporate performance.,"This study investigated whether the facial expressions of chief executive officers (CEOs) are associated with corporate performance. A photograph of the CEO or president of each company that appeared on the Fortune Global 500 list for 2018 was taken from the company's official website. The smile intensity and action unit activation in each face were calculated using a pre-trained machine learning algorithm, FACET. The results revealed a positive association between smile intensity and company profit, even when controlling for the company's geographic location (Western culture versus others) and the CEO's gender. Furthermore, when the type of smile was examined with the activation of each action unit, this significant positive association was identified in the dominant smile but not in the reward and affiliative smiles. Relationships among the leader's smile intensity, group strategy, and group performance are discussed."
38887551,Omalizumab in combination with subcutaneous immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple allergies associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a case report and a literature review.,"We describe the case of a 10-year-old boy with asthma (AS), accompanied by allergic rhinitis (AR), food allergy (FA), and combined attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who was treated at Shanghai Renji Hospital on 11 July 2020. The efficiency of the previous treatment with salmeterol/ticlosone was poor. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in development of neurological symptoms. Treatment with omalizumab in combination with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) was then initiated in our department based on anti-asthmatic therapy. Symptoms of asthma were completely controlled, and FA and AR symptoms improved. The treatment regimen led to a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms and the overall quality of life of the patient. The literature search was done in the PubMed database using ""attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder/ADHD"" and ""asthma"" as keywords, and we identified 47 relevant articles. In conclusion, our results show that treating asthma with omalizumab in combination with salmeterol/ticlosone and SCIT is efficient in controlling symptoms of multiple allergies and may lead to the improvement in ADHD symptoms and the overall quality of life of pediatric patients with ADHD. While current studies suggest that allergic diseases are closely related to ADHD, there is still a lack of studies or case reports of complete treatment protocols to provide clinical clues for management of the disease."
38886207,Sampling Strategies for Experimentally Mapping Molecular Fitness Landscapes Using High-Throughput Methods.,"Empirical studies of genotype-phenotype-fitness maps of proteins are fundamental to understanding the evolutionary process, in elucidating the space of possible genotypes accessible through mutations in a landscape of phenotypes and fitness effects. Yet, comprehensively mapping molecular fitness landscapes remains challenging since all possible combinations of amino acid substitutions for even a few protein sites are encoded by an enormous genotype space. High-throughput mapping of genotype space can be achieved using large-scale screening experiments known as multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs). However, to accommodate such multi-mutational studies, the size of MAVEs has grown to the point where a priori determination of sampling requirements is needed. To address this problem, we propose calculations and simulation methods to approximate minimum sampling requirements for multi-mutational MAVEs, which we combine with a new library construction protocol to experimentally validate our approximation approaches. Analysis of our simulated data reveals how sampling trajectories differ between simulations of nucleotide versus amino acid variants and among mutagenesis schemes. For this, we show quantitatively that marginal gains in sampling efficiency demand increasingly greater sampling effort when sampling for nucleotide sequences over their encoded amino acid equivalents. We present a new library construction protocol that efficiently maximizes sequence variation, and demonstrate using ultradeep sequencing that the library encodes virtually all possible combinations of mutations within the experimental design. Insights learned from our analyses together with the methodological advances reported herein are immediately applicable toward pooled experimental screens of arbitrary design, enabling further assay upscaling and expanded testing of genotype space."
38886859,Stem cell-based therapy for fibrotic diseases: mechanisms and pathways.,"Fibrosis is a pathological process, that could result in permanent scarring and impairment of the physiological function of the affected organ; this condition which is categorized under the term organ failure could affect various organs in different situations. The involvement of the major organs, such as the lungs, liver, kidney, heart, and skin, is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality across the world. Fibrotic disorders encompass a broad range of complications and could be traced to various illnesses and impairments; these could range from simple skin scars with beauty issues to severe rheumatologic or inflammatory disorders such as systemic sclerosis as well as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Besides, the overactivation of immune responses during any inflammatory condition causing tissue damage could contribute to the pathogenic fibrotic events accompanying the healing response; for instance, the inflammation resulting from tissue engraftment could cause the formation of fibrotic scars in the grafted tissue, even in cases where the immune system deals with hard to clear infections, fibrotic scars could follow and cause severe adverse effects. A good example of such a complication is post-Covid19 lung fibrosis which could impair the life of the affected individuals with extensive lung involvement. However, effective therapies that halt or slow down the progression of fibrosis are missing in the current clinical settings. Considering the immunomodulatory and regenerative potential of distinct stem cell types, their application as an anti-fibrotic agent, capable of attenuating tissue fibrosis has been investigated by many researchers. Although the majority of the studies addressing the anti-fibrotic effects of stem cells indicated their potent capabilities, the underlying mechanisms, and pathways by which these cells could impact fibrotic processes remain poorly understood. Here, we first, review the properties of various stem cell types utilized so far as anti-fibrotic treatments and discuss the challenges and limitations associated with their applications in clinical settings; then, we will summarize the general and organ-specific mechanisms and pathways contributing to tissue fibrosis; finally, we will describe the mechanisms and pathways considered to be employed by distinct stem cell types for exerting anti-fibrotic events."
38887166,Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids.,"Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol-free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single-electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions."
38886411,Cancer-associated Histone H3 N-terminal arginine mutations disrupt PRC2 activity and impair differentiation.,"Dysregulated epigenetic states are a hallmark of cancer and often arise from genetic alterations in epigenetic regulators. This includes missense mutations in histones, which, together with associated DNA, form nucleosome core particles. However, the oncogenic mechanisms of most histone mutations are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that cancer-associated histone mutations at arginines in the histone H3 N-terminal tail disrupt repressive chromatin domains, alter gene regulation, and dysregulate differentiation. We find that histone H3R2C and R26C mutants reduce transcriptionally repressive H3K27me3. While H3K27me3 depletion in cells expressing these mutants is exclusively observed on the minor fraction of histone tails harboring the mutations, the same mutants recurrently disrupt broad H3K27me3 domains in the chromatin context, including near developmentally regulated promoters. H3K27me3 loss leads to de-repression of differentiation pathways, with concordant effects between H3R2 and H3R26 mutants despite different proximity to the PRC2 substrate, H3K27. Functionally, H3R26C-expressing mesenchymal progenitor cells and murine embryonic stem cell-derived teratomas demonstrate impaired differentiation. Collectively, these data show that cancer-associated H3 N-terminal arginine mutations reduce PRC2 activity and disrupt chromatin-dependent developmental functions, a cancer-relevant phenotype."
38887528,Exfoliation of titanium nitride using a non-thermal plasma process.,"In this study, we present a novel approach for the exfoliation of titanium nitride (TiN) powders utilizing a rapid, facile, and environmentally friendly non-thermal plasma method. This method involves the use of an electric arc and nitrogen as the ambient gas at room temperature to generate ionized particles. These ionized species interact with the ceramic crystal of TiN, resulting in a pronounced structural expansion. The exfoliated TiN products were comprehensively characterized using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Remarkably, the cubic crystal structure of TiN was effectively retained, while the (200) crystal plane d-spacing increased from 2.08 to 3.09 Å, accompanied by a reduction in crystallite size and alterations in Raman vibrational modes. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence for the successful exfoliation of TiN structures using our innovative non-thermal plasma method, opening up exciting possibilities for advanced material applications."
38888029,Hollow Core-Shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with Tiny-Void Space Capable Fast-Charge and Low-Temperature Sodium Storage.,"Iron-based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium-ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core-shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny-void space (THoCS-0.6Ni) via a one-step spray-drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieve volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS-0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g-1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS-0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at -20 °C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core-shelled structure with tiny-void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast-charge and low-temperature storage features."
38886033,Oligo-benzamide-based peptide mimicking tools for modulating biology.,"The oligo-benzamide scaffold is a rigid organic framework that can hold 2-3 functional groups as O-alkyl substituents on its benzamide units, mirroring their natural arrangement in an α-helix. Oligo-benzamides demonstrated outstanding α-helix mimicry and can be readily synthesized by following high yielding and iterative reaction steps in both solution-phase and solid-phase. A number of oligo-benzamides have been designed to emulate α-helical peptide segments in biologically active proteins and showed strong protein binding, in turn effectively disrupting protein-protein interactions in vitro and in vivo. In this chapter, the design of oligo-benzamides for mimicking α-helices, efficient synthetic routes for producing them, and their biomedical studies showing remarkable potency in inhibiting protein functions are discussed."
38886543,Europe as a secondary distribution hub in the worldwide invasion of the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis.,"The potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis originates from the Andean Mountain region in South America and has unintentionally been introduced to all inhabited continents. Several studies have examined the population genetic structure of this pest in various countries by using microsatellite markers. However, merging microsatellite data produced from different laboratories is challenging and can introduce uncertainty when interpreting the results. To overcome this challenge and to explore invasion routes of this pest, we have genotyped 22 G. rostochiensis populations from all continents. Within populations, the highest genetic diversity was observed in the South American populations, the European populations showed an intermediate level of genetic diversity and the remaining populations were the less diverse. This confirmed pre-existing knowledge such as a first introduction event from South America to Europe, but the less diverse populations could originate either from South America or from Europe. At the continental scale, STRUCTURE genetic clustering output indicated that North America and Asia have experienced at least two introduction events. Comparing different evolutionary scenarios, the Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis showed that Europe served as a secondary distribution centre for the invasion of G. rostochiensis into all other continents (North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania)."
38887984,Stress-induced Rab11a-exosomes induce amphiregulin-mediated cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer.,"Exosomes are secreted vesicles made intracellularly in the endosomal system. We have previously shown that exosomes are not only made in late endosomes, but also in recycling endosomes marked by the monomeric G-protein Rab11a. These vesicles, termed Rab11a-exosomes, are preferentially secreted under nutrient stress from several cancer cell types, including HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. HCT116 Rab11a-exosomes have particularly potent signalling activities, some mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, amphiregulin (AREG). Mutant activating forms of KRAS, a downstream target of EGFR, are often found in advanced CRC. When absent, monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, which target the EGFR and block the effects of EGFR ligands, such as AREG, can be administered. Patients, however, inevitably develop resistance to cetuximab, either by acquiring KRAS mutations or via non-genetic microenvironmental changes. Here we show that nutrient stress in several CRC cell lines causes the release of AREG-carrying Rab11a-exosomes. We demonstrate that while soluble AREG has no effect, much lower levels of AREG bound to Rab11a-exosomes from cetuximab-resistant KRAS-mutant HCT116 cells, can suppress the effects of cetuximab on KRAS-wild type Caco-2 CRC cells. Using neutralising anti-AREG antibodies and an intracellular EGFR kinase inhibitor, we show that this effect is mediated via AREG activation of EGFR, and not transfer of activated KRAS. Therefore, presentation of AREG on Rab11a-exosomes affects its ability to compete with cetuximab. We propose that this Rab11a-exosome-mediated mechanism contributes to the establishment of resistance in cetuximab-sensitive cells and may explain why in cetuximab-resistant tumours only some cells carry mutant KRAS."
38886511,Serum protein profiling reveals mechanism of activated thrombus formation in patients with stroke and atrial fibrillation.,"Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease in which blood flow to the brain is suddenly disrupted, causing damage to nerve cells. It involves complex and diverse pathophysiological processes and the treatment strategies are also diverse. The treatment for patients with stroke and atrial fibrillation (AF) is aimed at suppressing thrombus formation and migration. However, information regarding the protein networking involved in different thrombus formation pathways in patients with AF and stroke is insufficient. We performed protein profiling of patients with ischemic stroke with and without AF to investigate the mechanisms of thrombus formation and its pathophysiological association while providing helpful information for treating and managing patients with AF. These two groups were compared to identify the protein networks related to thrombus formation in AF. We observed that patients with ischemic stroke and AF had activated inflammatory responses induced by C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1. In contrast, thyroid hormones were increased due to a decrease in transthyretin and retinol-binding protein 4 levels. The mechanism underlying enhanced cardiac activity, vasodilation, and the resulting thrombosis pathway were confirmed in AF. These findings will play an essential role in improving the prevention and treatment of AF-related stroke."
38885857,Unravelling biochemical and structural features of Bacillus licheniformis GH5 mannanase using site-directed mutagenesis and high-resolution protein crystallography studies.,"Glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) encompasses enzymes with several different activities, including endo-1,4-β-mannosidases. These enzymes are involved in mannan degradation, and have a number of biotechnological applications, such as mannooligosaccharide prebiotics production, stain removal and dyes decolorization, to name a few. Despite the importance of GH5 enzymes, only a few members of subfamily 7 were structurally characterized. In the present work, biochemical and structural characterization of Bacillus licheniformis GH5 mannanase, BlMan5_7 were performed and the enzyme cleavage pattern was analyzed, showing that BlMan5_7 requires at least 5 occupied subsites to perform efficient hydrolysis. Additionally, crystallographic structure at 1.3 Å resolution was determined and mannoheptaose (M7) was docked into the active site to investigate the interactions between substrate and enzyme through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, revealing the existence of a - 4 subsite, which might explain the generation of mannotetraose (M4) as an enzyme product. Biotechnological application of the enzyme in stain removal was investigated, demonstrating that BlMan5_7 addition to washing solution greatly improves mannan-based stain elimination."
38887350,Virtual Fracture Clinic Patients' Satisfaction Outcomes.,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a need to balance optimum treatment service and the safety of patients and hospital staff. The British Orthopaedic Association recommended a virtual fracture clinic to give the right first-time decision and to minimize patient exposure to disease. This study aimed to evaluate the patients' satisfaction outcomes for the service provided through the virtual fracture clinic. Methodology From January to May 2022, all patients seen by the staff in the Emergency Department (ED) at Queens Burton Hospitals were enrolled in a prospective study. An Excel spreadsheet was provided to both ED personnel and the orthopaedic team for accessibility. Patients were continually added to the spreadsheet, and their cases were reviewed by the on-call consultant to devise treatment plans. A satisfaction questionnaire was collected from patients about their virtual clinic experience as a route to provide treatment service. Results The study comprised 150 patients, with an average age of 40 years. Distal radial fractures represented one-third of the cases. Different modalities of management were offered such as a sling, splint, cast, or referral to physiotherapy. Around 75% of cases were satisfied, understood the advice given over the phone, and were not required to attend the actual clinic. The remaining quarter attended the clinic either for further reassessment by an orthopaedic surgeon or for discussion of their injury as they could not get the full message over the phone due to fast calls, hearing struggles, or just listening to messages. Conclusions The virtual fracture clinic is an effective standalone service that gained around 75% satisfaction in patients' outcome questionnaires. It saved the actual fracture clinic slots and hospital resources. It is recommended to be part of the standard daily practice throughout the United Kingdom."
38886623,Duvelisib plus romidepsin in relapsed/refractory T cell lymphomas: a phase 1b/2a trial.,"PI3K-δ inhibitors have shown impressive activity in lymphoid malignancies but have been hampered by autoimmune and infectious toxicities, leading to market withdrawals. We previously demonstrated activity of the PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib in T cell lymphomas (TCLs) that was associated with inflammatory adverse events. As reported here, we conducted a phase 1b/2a study of duvelisib in combination with either romidepsin (n = 66) or bortezomib (n = 32) in patients with relapsed/refractory TCL and found that the addition of romidepsin, but not bortezomib, appeared to increase efficacy while attenuating PI3K inhibitor-driven toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of duvelisib, which was 75 mg twice daily when combined with romidepsin versus 25 mg twice daily when combined with bortezomib. The most common adverse events were neutropenia (42%, 25/59) and fatigue (37%, 22/59) in patients treated with duvelisib and romidepsin and diarrhea (48%, 11/23) and neutropenia (30%, 7/23) in patients treated with duvelisib and bortezomib. Duvelisib and romidepsin resulted in less grade 3/4 hepatotoxicity (14%, 8/59) compared to 40% (14/35) in our previous study with duvelisib monotherapy. This was associated with reductions in circulating inflammatory mediators and myeloid cell inflammatory gene expression. Secondary endpoints of overall and complete response rates were 55% (35/64) and 34% (22/64) for patients treated with duvelisib and romidepsin and 34% (11/32) and 13% (4/32) for patients treated with duvelisib and bortezomib. Among patients with peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs), overall and complete response rates of duvelisib and romidepsin were 56% (27/48) and 44% (21/48), respectively, with exploratory analyses showing increased response rates in patients with a follicular helper T cell subtype. These findings support further development of combined PI3K and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition in TCLs and suggest a unique strategy to enable PI3K inhibitor-based combinations for additional patient populations.

38887004,Various retraction techniques for laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"The laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD), introduced by Gagner and Pomp in 1994, is typically done in high-volume centers due to its technical demands. Our methods aim to provide effective traction, enabling efficient surgery despite limited staffing. A retrospective analysis of 29 patients undergoing LPD by a single surgeon between September 2021 and December 2022 showed promising outcomes: median intraoperative bleeding of 425 mL, operation time of 505 minutes, and postoperative hospital stay of 10 days. With only one case requiring open conversion, our external retraction techniques demonstrate efficacy in overcoming challenges associated with manpower constraints, highlighting potential utility for surgeons in similar settings. We share LPD external retraction techniques and outcomes."
38886867,Retroperitoneal dermoid cyst complicated with uterine adenomyoma: a case report and literature review.,"Pelvic masses frequently originate from the pelvic cavity and are often associated with uterine, ovarian, or intestinal disorders. This report describes the case of a patient with a pelvic mass diagnosed as a retroperitoneal dermoid cyst at our hospital. We analyzed this case and conducted a literature review, to mitigate the risk of misdiagnosis and enhance the treatment of retroperitoneal masses."
38886292,Removing Adversarial Noise in X-ray Images via Total Variation Minimization and Patch-Based Regularization for Robust Deep Learning-based Diagnosis.,"Deep learning has significantly advanced the field of radiology-based disease diagnosis, offering enhanced accuracy and efficiency in detecting various medical conditions through the analysis of complex medical images such as X-rays. This technology's ability to discern subtle patterns and anomalies has proven invaluable for swift and accurate disease identification. The relevance of deep learning in radiology has been particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, where rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and containment. However, recent research has uncovered vulnerabilities in deep learning models when exposed to adversarial attacks, leading to incorrect predictions. In response to this critical challenge, we introduce a novel approach that leverages total variation minimization to combat adversarial noise within X-ray images effectively. Our focus narrows to COVID-19 diagnosis as a case study, where we initially construct a classification model through transfer learning designed to accurately classify lung X-ray images encompassing no pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia, and non-COVID pneumonia cases. Subsequently, we extensively evaluated the model's susceptibility to targeted and un-targeted adversarial attacks by employing the fast gradient sign gradient (FGSM) method. Our findings reveal a substantial reduction in the model's performance, with the average accuracy plummeting from 95.56 to 19.83% under adversarial conditions. However, the experimental results demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of the proposed denoising approach in enhancing the performance of diagnosis models when applied to adversarial examples. Post-denoising, the model exhibits a remarkable accuracy improvement, surging from 19.83 to 88.23% on adversarial images. These promising outcomes underscore the potential of denoising techniques to fortify the resilience and reliability of AI-based COVID-19 diagnostic systems, laying the foundation for their successful deployment in clinical settings."
38886069,Size-based expectation maximization for characterizing nucleosome positions and subtypes.,"Genome-wide nucleosome profiles are predominantly characterized using MNase-seq, which involves extensive MNase digestion and size selection to enrich for mono-nucleosome-sized fragments. Most available MNase-seq analysis packages assume that nucleosomes uniformly protect 147-bp DNA fragments. However, some nucleosomes with atypical histone or chemical compositions protect shorter lengths of DNA. The rigid assumptions imposed by current nucleosome analysis packages potentially prevent investigators from understanding the regulatory roles played by atypical nucleosomes. To enable the characterization of different nucleosome types from MNase-seq data, we introduce the Size-based Expectation Maximization (SEM) nucleosome-calling package. SEM employs a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model to estimate nucleosome positions and subtypes. Nucleosome subtypes are automatically identified based on the distribution of protected DNA fragments. Benchmark analysis indicates that SEM is on par with existing packages in terms of standard nucleosome-calling accuracy metrics, while uniquely providing the ability to characterize nucleosome subtype identities. Applying SEM to a low-dose MNase-H2B-ChIP-seq dataset from mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified three nucleosome types: short-fragment nucleosomes; canonical nucleosomes; and di-nucleosomes. Short-fragment nucleosomes can be divided further into two subtypes based on their chromatin accessibility. Interestingly, short-fragment nucleosomes in accessible regions exhibit high MNase sensitivity and are enriched at transcription start sites (TSSs) and CTCF peaks, similar to previously reported 'fragile nucleosomes'. These SEM-defined accessible short-fragment nucleosomes are found not just in promoters, but also in distal regulatory regions. Additional analyses reveal their colocalization with the chromatin remodelers Chd6, Chd8, and Ep400. In summary, SEM provides an effective platform for exploration of nonstandard nucleosome subtypes."
38887972,"PatternJ: an ImageJ toolset for the automated and quantitative analysis of regular spatial patterns found in sarcomeres, axons, somites, and more.","Regular spatial patterns are ubiquitous forms of organization in nature. In animals, regular patterns can be found from the cellular scale to the tissue scale, and from early stages of development to adulthood. To understand the formation of these patterns, how they assemble and mature, and how they are affected by perturbations, a precise quantitative description of the patterns is essential. However, accessible tools that offer in-depth analysis without the need for computational skills are lacking for biologists. Here, we present PatternJ, a novel toolset to analyze regular one-dimensional patterns precisely and automatically. This toolset, to be used with the popular imaging processing program ImageJ/Fiji, facilitates the extraction of key geometric features within and between pattern repeats in static images and time-lapse series. We validate PatternJ with simulated data and test it on images of sarcomeres from insect muscles and contracting cardiomyocytes, actin rings in neurons, and somites from zebrafish embryos obtained using confocal fluorescence microscopy, STORM, electron microscopy, and brightfield imaging. We show that the toolset delivers subpixel feature extraction reliably even with images of low signal-to-noise ratio. PatternJ's straightforward use and functionalities make it valuable for various scientific fields requiring quantitative one-dimensional pattern analysis, including the sarcomere biology of muscles or the patterning of mammalian axons, speeding up discoveries with the bonus of high reproducibility."
38886164,Morphological profiling for drug discovery in the era of deep learning.,"Morphological profiling is a valuable tool in phenotypic drug discovery. The advent of high-throughput automated imaging has enabled the capturing of a wide range of morphological features of cells or organisms in response to perturbations at the single-cell resolution. Concurrently, significant advances in machine learning and deep learning, especially in computer vision, have led to substantial improvements in analyzing large-scale high-content images at high throughput. These efforts have facilitated understanding of compound mechanism of action, drug repurposing, characterization of cell morphodynamics under perturbation, and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the field of morphological profiling. We summarize the image profiling analysis workflow, survey a broad spectrum of analysis strategies encompassing feature engineering- and deep learning-based approaches, and introduce publicly available benchmark datasets. We place a particular emphasis on the application of deep learning in this pipeline, covering cell segmentation, image representation learning, and multimodal learning. Additionally, we illuminate the application of morphological profiling in phenotypic drug discovery and highlight potential challenges and opportunities in this field."
38886750,Accounting for center-level effects in multicenter randomized controlled trials.,"Investigators often conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) at multiple centers/sites when determining the effect of a treatment or an intervention. Diversifying recruitment across multiple institutions allows investigators to make recruitment go faster within a shorter timeframe and allows generalizing the study results across diverse populations. Despite having a common study protocol across multiple centers, the eligible participants may be heterogeneous, site policies and practices may vary, and the investigators' experience, training, and expertise may also vary across sites. These factors may contribute to the heterogeneity in effect estimates across centers. As a result, we usually observe some degree of heterogeneity in effect estimates across centers, despite all centers following the same study protocol. During the analysis of such a trial, investigators typically ignore center effects, but some have suggested considering centers as fixed or random effects in the model. It is not clear how considering the effects of centers, either as fixed or random effects, impacts the test of the primary hypothesis. In this article, we first review the practice of accounting for center effects in the analyses of published RCTs and illustrate the extent of heterogeneity observed in a few preexisting multicenter RCTs. To determine the impact of heterogeneity on the test of a primary hypothesis of an RCT, we considered continuous and binary outcomes and the corresponding appropriate model, namely, a simple linear regression model for a continuous outcome and a logistic regression model for the binary outcome. For each model type, we considered three methods: (a) ignore the center effect, (b) account for centers as fixed effects, or (c) account for centers as random effects. Based on simulation studies of these models, we then examine whether considering the center as a fixed or random effect in the model helps to preserve or reduce the type I and type II error rates during the analysis phase of an RCT. Finally, we outline the threshold at which center-level effects are negligible and thus negligible and provide recommendations on when it may be necessary to account for center effects during the analyses of multicenter randomized controlled trials."
38886351,Synergistic immunochemotherapy targeted SAMD4B-APOA2-PD-L1 axis potentiates antitumor immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Targeted and immunotherapy combined with interventional therapy can improve the prognosis of advanced cancer patients, and it has become a hot spot to find the new therapeutic schemes, but most of which are not satisfactory. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in PDX mouse models with or without TCC therapy. 2-'O-Methylation modification and multiplex immunofluorescence staining were used to explore the function and mechanism of SAMD4B in the immune context of HCC. Here, we propose for the first time a synergistic immunochemotherapy that exerts a potent antitumour effect for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in clinical practice based on three common antitumour drugs and found that HCC patients with new synergistic immunochemotherapy had better three-year overall survival (p = 0.004) and significantly higher survival ratio (increased by 2.3 times) than the control group. We further reveal the immunoregulatory mechanism of synergistic immunochemotherapy through 2'-O-Methylation modification mediated by SAMD4B, a tumour suppressor gene. Mechanistically, SAMD4B, increased by the reduced mutations of upstream genes NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, affected the instability of APOA2 mRNA by 2-'O-Methylation modification of the C-terminus. The decreased APOA2 further attenuated programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) level with a direct interaction pattern. The high-SAMD4B tumour tissues contained fewer native CD29+CD8+ T cells, which improved immune microenvironment to achieve the effect of antitumour effect. Overall, we developed a potent synergistic immunochemotherapy strategy that exerts an efficient anti-HCC effect inducing SAMD4B-APOA2-PD-L1 axis to inhibit tumour immune evasion."
38886582,The SMC5/6 complex prevents genotoxicity upon APOBEC3A-mediated replication stress.,"Mutational patterns caused by APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase activity are evident throughout human cancer genomes. In particular, the APOBEC3A family member is a potent genotoxin that causes substantial DNA damage in experimental systems and human tumors. However, the mechanisms that ensure genome stability in cells with active APOBEC3A are unknown. Through an unbiased genome-wide screen, we define the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 5/6 (SMC5/6) complex as essential for cell viability when APOBEC3A is active. We observe an absence of APOBEC3A mutagenesis in human tumors with SMC5/6 dysfunction, consistent with synthetic lethality. Cancer cells depleted of SMC5/6 incur substantial genome damage from APOBEC3A activity during DNA replication. Further, APOBEC3A activity results in replication tract lengthening which is dependent on PrimPol, consistent with re-initiation of DNA synthesis downstream of APOBEC3A-induced lesions. Loss of SMC5/6 abrogates elongated replication tracts and increases DNA breaks upon APOBEC3A activity. Our findings indicate that replication fork lengthening reflects a DNA damage response to APOBEC3A activity that promotes genome stability in an SMC5/6-dependent manner. Therefore, SMC5/6 presents a potential therapeutic vulnerability in tumors with active APOBEC3A."
38885921,Impact of Post-Procedural Graft Flow on Outcomes Following Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention in Post-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients: a Detailed Angiographic Analysis.,"Chronic total occlusions (CTO) are frequent in patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the usual revascularization strategy. Whether or not the presence of a graft on a CTO vessel and post-PCI graft patency impacts outcomes following CTO-PCI is unknown. We sought to evaluate the impact of post-PCI graft patency on the durability of CTO-PCI. In total, 259 post-CABG patients undergoing CTO-PCI in 12 international centers in 2019-2023 were categorized into ""grafted"" and ""ungrafted"" groups based on the presence of graft on a CTO vessel. The grafted group was subdivided into ""graft-occluded"" and ""graft-patent"" groups, depending on graft patency. Primary endpoints were (a) technical success rate, (b) target vessel failure and (c) CTO failure rates at 1-year. CTO failure was defined as both target vessel revascularization and/or significant in-stent restenosis. A total of 199 patients (77%) were in the grafted group. Grafted CTOs showed higher complexity and lower technical success rates (70% vs. 80%, P=0.004) than non-grafted CTOs. Among the grafted CTOs, 140 (70%) were in the grafted-occluded group and 59 (30%) were in the grafted-patent group. The technical success was lower in the former group (65% vs. 81%, P=0.022). An occluded graft was an independent predictor of technical failure (OR=2.04; 95%CI: 1.03-4.76, p=0.049) and persistent post-PCI graft patency was a strong independent predictor of CTO failure at 1-year (HR=5.6, 95% CI: 1.2-27.5, log-rank P=0.033). In conclusion, in post-CABG patients undergoing CTO-PCI, post-PCI graft patency was a significant predictor of CTO failure."
38887516,Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data reveals a cellular senescence-related signature in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"The mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is on the rise globally, particularly in the Western world, with etiology gradually shifting from virus-related liver diseases to metabolic disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Early detection of HCC is challenging, and effective prognostic indicators are currently lacking, urgently necessitating reliable markers to assist in treatment planning and clinical management. Here, we introduce hepatocellular carcinoma senescence genes (HSG) to assess cellular senescence in HCC and devise a hepatocellular carcinoma senescence score (HSS) for prognostic prediction. Higher HSS levels signify poorer prognosis and increased tumor proliferation activity. Additionally, we observe alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment with higher HSS levels, such as increased infiltration of Treg, potentially providing a basis for immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identify key genes, such as PTTG1, within the senescence gene set and demonstrate their regulatory roles in HCC cells and Treg through experimentation. In summary, we establish a scoring system based on hepatocellular carcinoma senescence genes for prognostic prediction in HCC, potentially offering guidance for clinical treatment planning."
38887621,Maize residue retention shapes soil microbial communities and co-occurrence networks upon freeze-thawing cycles.,"Maize residue retention is an effective agricultural practice for improving soil fertility in black soil region, where suffered from long freezing-thawing periods and intense freeze-thawing (FT) cycles. However, very few studies have examined the influence of maize residue retention on soil microbial communities under FT cycles. We investigated the response of soil microbial communities and co-occurrence networks to maize residue retention at different FT intensities over 12 cycles using a microcosm experiment conditioned in a temperature incubator. Our results indicated that maize residue retention induced dramatic shifts in soil archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities towards copiotroph-dominated communities. Maize residue retention consistently reduced soil fungal richness across all cycles, but this effect was weaker for archaea and bacteria. Normalized stochastic ratio analysis revealed that maize residue retention significantly enhanced the deterministic process of archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities. Although FT intensity significantly impacted soil respiration, it did not induce profound changes in soil microbial diversity and community composition. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that maize residue retention simplified prokaryotic network, while did not impact fungal network complexity. The network robustness index suggested that maize residue retention enhanced the fungal network stability, but reduced prokaryotic network stability. Moreover, the fungal network in severe FT treatment harbored the most abundant keystone taxa, mainly being cold-adapted fungi. By identifying modules in networks, we observed that prokaryotic Module #1 and fungal Module #3 were enhanced by maize residue retention and contributed greatly to soil quality. Together, our results showed that maize residue retention exerted stronger influence on soil microbial communities and co-occurrence network patterns than FT intensity and highlighted the potential of microbial interactions in improving soil functionality."
38886931,Toward understanding the role of genomic repeat elements in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases cause great medical and economic burdens for both patients and society; however, the complex molecular mechanisms thereof are not yet well understood. With the development of high-coverage sequencing technology, researchers have started to notice that genomic repeat regions, previously neglected in search of disease culprits, are active contributors to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we describe the association between repeat element variants and multiple degenerative diseases through genome-wide association studies and targeted sequencing. We discuss the identification of disease-relevant repeat element variants, further powered by the advancement of long-read sequencing technologies and their related tools, and summarize recent findings in the molecular mechanisms of repeat element variants in brain degeneration, such as those causing transcriptional silencing or RNA-mediated gain of toxic function. Furthermore, we describe how in silico predictions using innovative computational models, such as deep learning language models, could enhance and accelerate our understanding of the functional impact of repeat element variants. Finally, we discuss future directions to advance current findings for a better understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and the clinical applications of genomic repeat elements."
38886061,Major burns in adults: a practice review.,"There are approximately 180 000 deaths per year from thermal burn injury worldwide. Most burn injuries can be treated in local hospitals but 6.5% require specialist burn care. The initial ED assessment, resuscitation and critical care of the severely burned patient present significant challenges and require a multidisciplinary approach. The management of these patients in the resuscitation room impacts on the effectiveness of continuing care in the intensive care unit. The scope of the present practice review is the immediate management of the adult patient with severe burns, including inhalation injury and burn shock. The article uses an illustrative case to highlight recent developments including advanced airway management and the contemporary approach to assessment of fluid requirements and the type and volume of fluid resuscitation. There is discussion on new options for pain relief in the ED and the principles governing the early stages of burn intensive care. It does not discuss minor injuries, mass casualty events, chemical or radiation injuries, exfoliative or necrotising conditions or frost bite."
38886449,A method to accelerate computational efficiency by more than two orders of magnitude for Monte Carlo simulations of electron-solid interactions.,"A method has been developed to increase computational efficiency in Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport and interactions in matter. The method serves as the computational engine for the open-source code AMCSET (Aggie Monte Carlo Simulations of Electron and Ion Transport). The key is to combine n consecutive neighboring free flying distances into groups. Within each group, both flying distance and Mott scattering angles are obtained using Monte Carlo sampling under an equal energy approximation. This reduces the number of integrations of the tabulated differential Mott scattering cross-section in scattering angle selection, i.e., from 1000 to 1 if n = 1000. The method increases efficiency by more than 100 times. At the same time, the calculation still guarantees accuracy in calculating electron trajectory, excitation/ionization energy deposition, elastic scattering energy deposition, and displacement creation. For demonstration, 10 MeV electron bombardments of pure Fe with n up to 1000 are used as examples. The method, due to the availability of tabulated scattering cross-sections, is applicable for targets of the entire elemental table up to Z = 118, and for electron energies up to 900 MeV."
38886279,Racial Disparities in Medical Management of Uterine Fibroids Prior to Myomectomy or Hysterectomy.,"The symptomatic burden of uterine fibroids has been demonstrated to disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic women. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if racial disparities seen in disease severity in regards to bleeding symptoms and surgical management also applied to presurgical medical management. A retrospective chart review evaluated women aged 18-50 with the diagnosis of fibroids who underwent a myomectomy or hysterectomy between 2012 and 2021. Black and Hispanic women were more likely to have preoperative hemoglobin values under 10 mg/dL (p < 0.001) and had higher rates of preoperative blood transfusions than White women (p = 0.001). Black women utilized the highest number of medications before excisional procedures, followed by Hispanic women. Asian women reported the lowest average (p = 0.037). There was no preferential use of GnRH analogues, intrauterine devices, or oral hormonal therapies between races. Minor procedures were infrequently utilized without statistically significant variations among races. This study confirms previous evidence that Black and Hispanic women are more severely affected by uterine fibroids. This severity is mirrored in increased utilization of medications, but patients continue to be under optimized prior to surgery. Further research should identify factors preventing these groups from achieving better symptom control preoperatively."
38886840,Porcine deltacoronavirus nonstructural protein 2 inhibits type I and III IFN production by targeting STING for degradation.,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that has been reported to use various strategies to counter the host antiviral innate immune response. The cGAS-STING signalling pathway plays an important role in antiviral innate immunity. However, it remains unclear whether PDCoV achieves immune evasion by regulating the cGAS-STING pathway. Here, we demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) encoded by PDCoV inhibits cGAS-STING-mediated type I and III interferon (IFN) responses via the regulation of porcine STING (pSTING) stability. Mechanistically, ectopically expressed PDCoV nsp2 was found to interact with the N-terminal region of pSTING. Consequently, pSTING was degraded through K48-linked ubiquitination and the proteasomal pathway, leading to the disruption of cGAS-STING signalling. Furthermore, K150 and K236 of pSTING were identified as crucial residues for nsp2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. In summary, our findings provide a basis for elucidating the immune evasion mechanism of PDCoV and will contribute to the development of targets for anti-coronavirus drugs."
38885946,"Comparative genomics of dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus, Sciaenidae) conspecifics: Evidence for speciation and the genetic mechanisms underlying traits.","Dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus) is a commercially important finfish, indigenous to South Africa, Australia, and China. Previous studies highlighted differences in genetic composition, life history, and morphology of the species across geographic regions. A draft genome sequence of 0.742 Gb (N50 = 5.49 Mb; BUSCO completeness = 97.8%) and 22,438 predicted protein-coding genes was generated for the South African (SA) conspecific. A comparison with the Chinese (CN) conspecific revealed a core set of 32,068 orthologous protein clusters across both genomes. The SA genome exhibited 440 unique clusters compared to 1928 unique clusters in the CN genome. Transportation and immune response processes were overrepresented among the SA accessory genome, whereas the CN accessory genome was enriched for immune response, DNA transposition, and sensory detection (FDR-adjusted p < 0.01). These unique clusters may represent an adaptive component of the species' pangenome that could explain population divergence due to differential environmental specialisation. Furthermore, 700 single-copy orthologues (SCOs) displayed evidence of positive selection between the SA and CN genomes, and globally these genomes shared only 92% similarity, suggesting they might be distinct species. These genes primarily play roles in metabolism and digestion, illustrating the evolutionary pathways that differentiate the species. Understanding these genomic mechanisms underlying adaptation and evolution within and between species provides valuable insights into growth and maturation of kob, traits that are particularly relevant to commercial aquaculture."
38887903,Identification of the novel HLA-DPA1*01:195 allele by next-generation sequencing.,The novel HLA-DPA1*01:195 allele differs from HLA-DPA1*01:03:01:01 by one nucleotide substitution in exon 4.
38886978,Pedicled SCIP-based vascularized lymphnode and lymphatic vessels transfer (VLNT and VLVT) for deep lymphatic system reconstruction and dead space obliteration after medial thigh sarcoma resection: A case report.,"Soft-tissue sarcomas represent a cohort of rare and heterogeneous malignant tumors that could affect various body parts, with a higher incidence in the lower extremity. When these tumors are surgically removed, both the superficial and deep lymphatic pathways could also be damaged and might require immediate reconstruction to prevent lymphatic complications. In the present report, we describe a case of a patient affected by a high-grade (G3) spindle cell pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma of the upper medial thigh. A 22 × 20 cm mass was removed with exposure of the deep femoral vessels and the great saphenous vein. After intraoperative indocyanine green lymphography, it was determined that the superficial lymphatic vessels were intact, but the deep lymphatic system was unavoidably damaged. As a reconstructive procedure, we performed a pedicled SCIP-based vascularized lymphatic vessel transfer and vascularized lymph node transfer to restore the deep lymphatic system and dead space obliteration. The procedure was successful, and no signs of lymphatic impairment were observed during the two-year follow-up period. We believe that this novel approach might be helpful in cases of large and profound defects that involve the deep lymphatic system. The combination of these two techniques could help restore deep lymph drainage, minimizing the risk of superficial system overload and lymphatic dysfunction. No other cases have been described so far employing the same approach. Considering the obtained results, this procedure might be worth further investigation."
38886032,Molecular design of peptide therapeutics via N-terminal modification.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon are three naturally occurring peptide hormones that mediate glucoregulation. Several agonists representing appropriately modified native ligands have been developed to maximize metabolic benefits with reduced side-effects and many have entered the clinic as type 2 diabetes and obesity therapeutics. In this work, we describe strategies for improving the stability of the peptide ligands by making them refractory to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 catalyzed hydrolysis and inactivation. We describe a series of alkylations with variations in size, shape, charge, polarity, and stereochemistry that are able to engender full activity at the receptor(s) while simultaneously resisting enzyme-mediated degradation. Utilizing this strategy, we offer a novel method of modulating receptor activity and fine-tuning pharmacology without a change in peptide sequence."
38887359,Dr. Newton Shaffer (1846-1928): Renowned Orthopedic Surgeon and Founder of the American Orthopaedic Association.,"An unsung hero of American orthopedic surgery is the largely forgotten Dr. Newton Melman Shaffer (1846-1928). Upon graduating from medical school at New York University, Shaffer began his career training at the Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled in 1867. Shaffer then went on to practice at St. Luke's Hospital and New York Orthopaedic Dispensary and Hospital where he became chief. Here, Shaffer made major contributions to the field in treating clubfoot and tuberculosis. He then declared orthopedics as a separate entity from general surgery at the 10th International Medical Congress. He helped start the American Orthopaedic Association to push for the recognition of American orthopedics to the international community. In 1900, Shaffer opened the first state-run hospital for underprivileged children requiring rehabilitation. During his career, Shaffer advocated for conservative orthopedic treatments, aided in the invention of medical devices, contributed largely to academic orthopedics, and successfully advocated for the inception of the field of orthopedic surgery."
38887564,Methods of prolonging the effect of caudal block in children.,"Caudal epidural blockade is one of the most frequently administered regional anesthesia techniques in children. It is a supplement during general anesthesia and for providing postoperative analgesia in pediatrics for sub-umbilical surgeries, especially for genitourinary surgeries. However, the duration of the analgesic effect is occasionally unsatisfactory. In this review, we discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of different techniques to prolong postoperative analgesia for single-injection caudal blockade in children. A literature search of the keywords ""caudal"", ""analgesia"", ""pediatric"", and ""children"" was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases. We highlight that analgesic quality correlates substantially with the local anesthetic's type, dose, the timing relationship between caudal block and surgery, caudal catheterization, and administration of epidural opioids or other adjuvant drugs."
38886983,'I've got to go in there with my armour on': Adverse Childhood Experiences Among Adults Who Frequently Attend Emergency Departments.,"Frequent presentations to emergency departments contribute to increased service demands and healthcare costs. Literature suggests these adult presentations may be influenced by childhood adversity. This qualitatively driven, mixed methods study explored the self-perceived role of childhood adversity in the health of adults who frequently attended Australian Emergency Departments and their perceptions of the healthcare they received. Data were collected using validated instruments and semi-structured interviews with 12 purposefully sampled adults who frequently attended emergency departments. Qualitative data were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Three major themes were identified-The experience of childhood adversity: articulating challenges related to childhood trauma, and the subsequent impacts on participants' health, behaviours, relationships and sense of control; Pursuing safety: exploring action participants took to keep themselves and others safe, with this requirement extending into adulthood and influencing Emergency Department presentations; and Seeking humanising healthcare: identifying challenges participants experienced while seeking care in the Emergency Department. Participants perceived their mental health to be profoundly affected by their past experiences of trauma, leaving them feeling vulnerable at times and more likely to experience re-traumatisation in the Emergency Department. Feelings of stigmatisation during Emergency Department encounters led participants to employ self-protection strategies creating further barriers to recovery. Participants described Emergency Departments as often failing to comprehensively address their healthcare needs. They offered suggestions for more effective care interventions. Findings highlight the need for further research to inform policy and practice when designing and implementing interventions for these adults. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guided study reporting."
38887749,Breaking New Ground in Interventional Pulmonology: Integrating Cone Beam CT and Robotic-Assisted Bronchoscopy for High-Risk Pneumothorax in Peripherally Located Solitary Pulmonary Nodules.,"Lung cancer, a leading cause of global cancer-related deaths, necessitates the development of innovative diagnostic techniques. Traditional bronchoscopy, while useful, has limitations in diagnosing peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) and carries a higher risk of complications such as pneumothorax. However, the field of interventional pulmonology has seen significant advancements, including the introduction of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB), cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS), and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). These advancements have greatly improved the precision of diagnosing high-risk PPLs. This report presents the case of a 60-year-old female smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and extensive centrilobular emphysema, who had a peripherally located high-risk pulmonary nodule. She was successfully diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma using an integrated approach, despite the challenging location of the lesion and high risk of pneumothorax. The integration of RAB with CBCT and augmented fluoroscopy offers a groundbreaking approach for diagnosing and managing difficult-to-reach, high-risk pulmonary nodules, marking a significant stride in the field of interventional pulmonology."
38887353,Serum Osteopontin as a Potential Marker for Metastasis and Prognosis in Primary Osteogenic Sarcoma: A Systematic Review.,"Osteosarcoma (OS), a primary malignant bone tumor, poses significant challenges in diagnosis and prognosis. It is a painful medical burden, and treating it is still a difficult issue. Osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein, has emerged as a promising biomarker in this context. This systematic review explores the role of OPN as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in OS, highlighting its potential in enhancing early detection, monitoring disease progression, and predicting patient outcomes. Various studies have demonstrated elevated levels of OPN in OS patients, correlating with tumor aggressiveness, metastatic potential, and poor prognosis. In addition, OPN's involvement in tumor microenvironment regulation and metastatic processes underscores its clinical relevance as a biomarker. For this systematic review, comprehensive literature searches were conducted in the PubMed databases for research published between the database's establishment and November 11, 2022. Out of the nine studies that were available for analysis, a higher level of OPN in primary osteogenic sarcoma patients indicates a poorer prognosis and higher incidence of metastasis. OS has not shown commensurable progress with concerns to treatment approches and survical outcomes. However, the discovery of a biological marker that can predict metastasis and severity will be a groundbreaking development for advancements in OS diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, understanding the intricate interplay between OPN and OS pathogenesis holds promise for improving patient management and developing targeted therapeutic strategies."
38888048,Microbiota and metabolite alterations in pancreatic head and body/tail cancer patients.,"Pancreatic head cancer (PHC) and pancreatic body/tail cancer (PBTC) have distinct clinical and biological behaviors. The microbial and metabolic differences in PHC and PBTC have not been studied. The pancreatic microbiota and metabolome of 15 PHC and 8 PBTC tissues and their matched nontumor tissues were characterized using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. At the genus level, Bradyrhizobium was increased while Corynebacterium and Ruminococcus were decreased in the PHC tissues (Head T) compared with the matched nontumor tissues (Head N) significantly. Shuttleworthia, Bacillus, and Bifidobacterium were significantly decreased in the PBTC tissues (Body/Tail T) compared with the matched nontumor tissues (Body/Tail N). Significantly, Ileibacterium was increased whereas Pseudoxanthomonas was decreased in Head T and Body/Tail T, and Lactobacillus was increased in Head T but decreased in Body/Tail T. A total of 102 discriminative metabolites were identified between Head T and Head N, which were scattered through linoleic acid metabolism and purine metabolism pathways. However, there were only four discriminative metabolites between Body/Tail T and Body/Tail N, which were related to glycerophospholipid metabolism and autophagy pathways. The differential metabolites in PHC and PBTC were commonly enriched in alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and choline metabolism in cancer pathways. Eubacterium decreased in Head T was positively correlated with decreased linoleic acid while negatively correlated with increased arachidyl carnitine and stearoylcarnitine. Bacillus decreased in Body/Tail T was negatively correlated with increased L-carnitine. These microbiota and metabolites deserve further investigations to reveal their roles in the pathogenesis of PHC and PBTC, providing clues for future treatments."
38887153,Photoswitchable carbamazepine analogs for non-invasive neuroinhibition in vivo.,"A problem of systemic pharmacotherapy is off-target activity, which causes adverse effects. Outstanding examples include neuroinhibitory medications like antiseizure drugs, which are used against epilepsy and neuropathic pain but cause systemic side effects. There is a need of drugs that inhibit nerve signals locally and on-demand without affecting other regions of the body. Photopharmacology aims to address this problem with light-activated drugs and localized illumination in the target organ. Here, we have developed photoswitchable derivatives of the widely prescribed antiseizure drug carbamazepine. For that purpose, we expanded our method of ortho azologization of tricyclic drugs to meta/para and to N-bridged diazocine. Our results validate the concept of ortho cryptoazologs (uniquely exemplified by Carbazopine-1) and bring to light Carbadiazocine (8), which can be photoswitched between 400-590 nm light (using violet LEDs and halogen lamps) and shows good drug-likeness and predicted safety. Both compounds display photoswitchable activity in vitro and in translucent zebrafish larvae. Carbadiazocine (8) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy (mechanical and thermal stimuli) in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non-invasive illumination."
38887570,Diameter-selective extraction of single-walled carbon nanotubes by interlocking with Cu-tethered square nanobrackets.,"We have been working with carbon nanotube separation through host-guest chemistry. Herein, a new macrocyclic host molecule, Cu-tethered square nanobrackets, is designed, synthesized and applied to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) for their diameter-based separation. The complexation between copper ions and dipyrrin moieties of the nanobracket gives Cu-tethered square nanobrackets, which is confirmed by absorption, Raman and MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Upon extraction of SWNTs with the nanobracket and copper(II), in situ-formed square Cu-nanobrackets are found to interlock SWNTs to disperse them in 2-propanol. The interlocking is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy after thorough washing of the extracted SWNTs. Pristine SWNTs were recovered through demetalation of the interlocked ones along with the nanobracket. Raman and absorption spectroscopies of the extracted SWNTs reveals the diameter enrichment of only several kinds of SWNTs in the diameter range from 0.94 to 1.10 nm among ≈20 kinds of SWNTs from 0.76 to 1.20 nm in their diameter range. The diameter selectivity is supported by the theoretical calculations with the GFN2-xTB method, indicating that the most preferred SWNT diameter for the square Cu-nanobrackets is 1.04 nm."
38888046,Evaluation of TrpM and PsiD substrate promiscuity reveals new biocatalytic capabilities.,"N-methylated tryptamines, such as the hallucinogenic natural products, psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), are gaining interest from the medical community due to their potential as next generation treatments for mental health disorders. The clinical relevance of these compounds has driven scientists to develop biosynthetic production routes to a number of tryptamine drug candidates, and efforts are ongoing to expand and further develop these biosynthetic capabilities. To that end, we have further characterized the substrate preferences of two enzymes involved in tryptamine biosynthesis: TrpM, a tryptophan N-methyltransferase from Psilocybe serbica, and PsiD, the gateway decarboxylase of the psilocybin biosynthesis pathway. Here, we show that TrpM can N-methylate the non-native amino acid substrate, 4-hydroxytryptophan, a key intermediate in the Escherichia coli-based recombinant psilocybin biosynthesis pathway. However, the ability to incorporate TrpM into a functional psilocybin biosynthesis pathway was thwarted by PsiD's inability to use N,N-dimethyl-4-hydroxytryptophan as substrate, under the culturing conditions tested, despite demonstrating activity on N-methylated and 4-hydroxylated tryptophan derivatives individually. Taken together, this work expands upon the known substrates for TrpM and PsiD, further increasing the diversity of tryptamine biosynthetic products."
38886007,Network pharmacology study on fermented soybeans for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in older individuals.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the disruption of synaptic communication among millions of neurons. Recent research has highlighted the potential therapeutic effectiveness of natural polyphenolic compounds in addressing AD. Soybeans are abundant in polyphenols, and their polyphenolic composition undergoes significant alteration through fermentation by Eurotium cristatum. Through comprehensive database searches, we identified active components within fermented soybean polyphenols and genes associated with AD. Subsequently, we utilized Venn diagrams to analyze the overlap between AD-related genes and these components. Furthermore, we visualized the network between intersecting targets and proteins using Cytoscape software. The anti-AD effects of soybeans were further explored through comprehensive analysis, including protein-protein interaction analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and molecular docking studies. Our investigation unveiled 6-hydroxydaidzein as a major component of fermented soybean polyphenols, shedding light on its potential therapeutic significance in combating AD. The intersection between target proteins of fermented soybeans and disease-related targets in AD comprised 34 genes. Protein-protein interaction analysis highlighted key potential targets, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B), amyloid precursor protein (APP), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Molecular docking results demonstrated a robust binding effect between major components from fermented soybeans and the aforesaid key targets implicated in AD treatment. These findings suggest that fermented soybeans demonstrate a degree of efficacy and present promising prospects in the prevention of AD."

38887788,Self-regulation and comprehension in shared reading: The moderating effects of verbal interactions and E-book discussion prompts.,"The study examined how children's self-regulation skills measured by the strengths and weaknesses of ADHD symptoms and normal behavior rating are associated with story comprehension and how verbal engagement and e-book discussion prompts moderate this relation. Children aged 3-7 (N = 111, 50% female, Chinese as first language) read an interactive Chinese-English bilingual story e-book with or without discussion prompts twice with their parents (2020-2021). Results demonstrated that the lower children's self-regulation skills, the more they struggled with story comprehension. Critically, our data suggest that embedding e-book discussion prompts and more verbalization in English can mitigate this negative association for children with inattention/hyperactivity. These findings have critical implications for future e-book design, interventions, and home reading practice for children with inattention/hyperactivity and those at risk for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder."
38885806,CLK3 positively promoted colorectal cancer proliferation by activating IL-6/STAT3 signaling.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a significant challenge in oncology due to its increasing global incidence and treatment complexities. This study delved into the role of the dual-specificity protein kinase CLK3 in CRC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. By analyzing clinical data and experimental models comprehensively, we found that CLK3 expression was markedly elevated in CRC tissues compared to normal colon tissue. High CLK3 levels were associated with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis in CRC patients, suggesting its utility as a prognostic biomarker. Functional assays demonstrated that CLK3 overexpression boosted CRC cell proliferation and ATP production, whereas genetic CLK3 knockdown hindered cell proliferation in vitro and curbed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we uncovered that CLK3 positively influenced the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway by stabilizing JAK2 protein levels. These findings propose targeting CLK3 signaling as a promising therapeutic approach for CRC. Further investigation into CLK3's molecular mechanisms and clinical implications is necessary to fully harness its potential in managing CRC."
38887546,"Feasibility exploration of GSH in the treatment of acute hepatic encephalopathy from the aspects of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and mechanism.","Our previous study highlighted the therapeutic potential of glutathione (GSH), an intracellular thiol tripeptide ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, in mitigating hepatic and cerebral damage. Building on this premise, we posited the hypothesis that GSH could be a promising candidate for treating acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE). To verify this conjecture, we systematically investigated the feasibility of GSH as a therapeutic agent for AHE through comprehensive pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and mechanistic studies using a thioacetamide-induced AHE rat model. Our pharmacodynamic data demonstrated that oral GSH could significantly improve behavioral scores and reduce hepatic damage of AHE rats by regulating intrahepatic ALT, AST, inflammatory factors, and homeostasis of amino acids. Additionally, oral GSH demonstrated neuroprotective effects by alleviating the accumulation of intracerebral glutamine, down-regulating glutamine synthetase, and reducing taurine exposure. Pharmacokinetic studies suggested that AHE modeling led to significant decrease in hepatic and cerebral exposure of GSH and cysteine. However, oral GSH greatly enhanced the intrahepatic and intracortical GSH and CYS in AHE rats. Given the pivotal roles of CYS and GSH in maintaining redox homeostasis, we investigated the interplay between oxidative stress and pathogenesis/treatment of AHE. Our data revealed that GSH administration significantly relieved oxidative stress levels caused by AHE modeling via down-regulating the expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and NF-κB P65. Importantly, our findings further suggested that GSH administration significantly regulated the excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by AHE modeling through the iNOS/ATF4/Ddit3 pathway. In summary, our study uncovered that exogenous GSH could stabilize intracerebral GSH and CYS levels to act on brain oxidative and ER stress, which have great significance for revealing the therapeutic effect of GSH on AHE and promoting its further development and clinical application."
38886513,Robust load-frequency control of islanded urban microgrid using 1PD-3DOF-PID controller including mobile EV energy storage.,"Electricity generation in Islanded Urban Microgrids (IUMG) now relies heavily on a diverse range of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). However, the dependable utilization of these sources hinges upon efficient Electrical Energy Storage Systems (EESs). As the intermittent nature of RES output and the low inertia of IUMGs often lead to significant frequency fluctuations, the role of EESs becomes pivotal. While these storage systems effectively mitigate frequency deviations, their high costs and elevated power density requirements necessitate alternative strategies to balance power supply and demand. In recent years, substantial attention has turned towards harnessing Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries as Mobile EV Energy Storage (MEVES) units to counteract frequency variations in IUMGs. Integrating MEVES into the IUMG infrastructure introduces complexity and demands a robust control mechanism for optimal operation. Therefore, this paper introduces a robust, high-order degree of freedom cascade controller known as the 1PD-3DOF-PID (1 + Proportional + Derivative-Three Degrees Of Freedom Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for Load Frequency Control (LFC) in IUMGs integrated with MEVES. The controller's parameters are meticulously optimized using the Coati Optimization Algorithm (COA) which mimics coati behavior in nature, marking its debut in LFC of IUMG applications. Comparative evaluations against classical controllers and algorithms, such as 3DOF-PID, PID, Reptile Search Algorithm, and White Shark Optimizer, are conducted under diverse IUMG operating scenarios. The testbed comprises various renewable energy sources, including wind turbines, photovoltaics, Diesel Engine Generators (DEGs), Fuel Cells (FCs), and both Mobile and Fixed energy storage units. Managing power balance in this entirely renewable environment presents a formidable challenge, prompting an examination of the influence of MEVES, DEG, and FC as controllable units to mitigate active power imbalances. Metaheuristic algorithms in MATLAB-SIMULINK platforms are employed to identify the controller's gains across all case studies, ensuring the maintenance of IUMG system frequency within predefined limits. Simulation results convincingly establish the superiority of the proposed controller over other counterparts. Furthermore, the controller's robustness is rigorously tested under ± 25% variations in specific IUMG parameters, affirming its resilience. Statistical analyses reinforce the robust performance of the COA-based 1PD-3DOF-PID control method. This work highlights the potential of the COA Technique-optimized 1PD-3DOF-PID controller for IUMG control, marking its debut application in the LFC domain for IUMGs. This comprehensive study contributes valuable insights into enhancing the reliability and stability of Islanded Urban Microgrids while integrating Mobile EV Energy Storage, marking a significant advancement in the field of Load-Frequency Control."
38886957,Maintaining moderate levels of hypochlorous acid promotes neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the recovery phase of stroke.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202503000-00029/figure1/v/2024-06-17T092413Z/r/image-tiff It has been shown clinically that continuous removal of ischemia/reperfusion-induced reactive oxygen species is not conducive to the recovery of late stroke. Indeed, previous studies have shown that excessive increases in hypochlorous acid after stroke can cause severe damage to brain tissue. Our previous studies have found that a small amount of hypochlorous acid still exists in the later stage of stroke, but its specific role and mechanism are currently unclear. To simulate stroke in vivo, a middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model was established, with an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation model established in vitro to mimic stroke. We found that in the early stage (within 24 hours) of ischemic stroke, neutrophils produced a large amount of hypochlorous acid, while in the recovery phase (10 days after stroke), microglia were activated and produced a small amount of hypochlorous acid. Further, in acute stroke in rats, hypochlorous acid production was prevented using a hypochlorous acid scavenger, taurine, or myeloperoxidase inhibitor, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide. Our results showed that high levels of hypochlorous acid (200 μM) induced neuronal apoptosis after oxygen/glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. However, in the recovery phase of the middle cerebral artery occlusion model, a moderate level of hypochlorous acid promoted the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons and astrocytes. This suggests that hypochlorous acid plays different roles at different phases of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Lower levels of hypochlorous acid (5 and 100 μM) promoted nuclear translocation of β-catenin. By transfection of single-site mutation plasmids, we found that hypochlorous acid induced chlorination of the β-catenin tyrosine 30 residue, which promoted nuclear translocation. Altogether, our study indicates that maintaining low levels of hypochlorous acid plays a key role in the recovery of neurological function."
38885939,Analysis of the effect of inert gas on alveolar/venous blood partial pressure by using the operator splitting method.,"This study aims to investigate how inert gas affects the partial pressure of alveolar and venous blood using a fast and accurate operator splitting method (OSM). Unlike previous complex methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), OSM effectively separates governing equations into smaller sub-problems, facilitating a better understanding of inert gas transport and exchange between blood capillaries and surrounding tissue. The governing equations were discretized with a fully implicit finite difference method (FDM), which enables the use of larger time steps. The model employed partial differential equations, considering convection-diffusion in blood and only diffusion in tissue. The study explores the impact of initial arterial pressure, breathing frequency, blood flow velocity, solubility, and diffusivity on the partial pressure of inert gas in blood and tissue. Additionally, the effects of anesthetic inert gas and oxygen on venous blood partial pressure were analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the high solubility and diffusivity of anesthetic inert gas lead to its prolonged presence in blood and tissue, resulting in lower partial pressure in venous blood. These findings enhance our understanding of inert gas interaction with alveolar/venous blood, with potential implications for medical diagnostics and therapies."
38886941,Meningeal lymphatic vessel crosstalk with central nervous system immune cells in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Meningeal lymphatic vessels form a relationship between the nervous system and periphery, which is relevant in both health and disease. Meningeal lymphatic vessels not only play a key role in the drainage of brain metabolites but also contribute to antigen delivery and immune cell activation. The advent of novel genomic technologies has enabled rapid progress in the characterization of myeloid and lymphoid cells and their interactions with meningeal lymphatic vessels within the central nervous system. In this review, we provide an overview of the multifaceted roles of meningeal lymphatic vessels within the context of the central nervous system immune network, highlighting recent discoveries on the immunological niche provided by meningeal lymphatic vessels. Furthermore, we delve into the mechanisms of crosstalk between meningeal lymphatic vessels and immune cells in the central nervous system under both homeostatic conditions and neurodegenerative diseases, discussing how these interactions shape the pathological outcomes. Regulation of meningeal lymphatic vessel function and structure can influence lymphatic drainage, cerebrospinal fluid-borne immune modulators, and immune cell populations in aging and neurodegenerative disorders, thereby playing a key role in shaping meningeal and brain parenchyma immunity."

This catalytic process provides both symmetrical and unsymmetrical dialkyl bromoketones with moderate yields across a broad range of bromoalkene substrates. Our studies also reveal the formation of Ritter-type side products by an alternative reaction pathway.
38886955,Repetitive traumatic brain injury-induced complement C1-related inflammation impairs long-term hippocampal neurogenesis.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202503000-00027/figure1/v/2024-06-17T092413Z/r/image-tiff Repetitive traumatic brain injury impacts adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, leading to long-term cognitive impairment. However, the mechanism underlying this neurogenesis impairment remains unknown. In this study, we established a male mouse model of repetitive traumatic brain injury and performed long-term evaluation of neurogenesis of the hippocampal dentate gyrus after repetitive traumatic brain injury. Our results showed that repetitive traumatic brain injury inhibited neural stem cell proliferation and development, delayed neuronal maturation, and reduced the complexity of neuronal dendrites and spines. Mice with repetitive traumatic brain injuryalso showed deficits in spatial memory retrieval. Moreover, following repetitive traumatic brain injury, neuroinflammation was enhanced in the neurogenesis microenvironment where C1q levels were increased, C1q binding protein levels were decreased, and canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling was downregulated. An inhibitor of C1 reversed the long-term impairment of neurogenesis induced by repetitive traumatic brain injury and improved neurological function. These findings suggest that repetitive traumatic brain injury-induced C1-related inflammation impairs long-term neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and contributes to spatial memory retrieval dysfunction."
38886318,Overdosage Section in US and EU Labeling.,"The Prescribing Information (PI) in the United States (US) and the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) in the European Union (EU) are approved by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively. The inclusion of overdosage information in these documents is a regulatory requirement in both regions. This research evaluates the content of the overdosage section of US and EU labeling. The overdosage sections of labels for drugs approved in the US in three time periods were analyzed: 2000-2001, 2010-2011, and 2020-2021. EU labels for these same products were also reviewed if registered through the Centralized Procedure. Data collection and analyses were performed using a predefined questionnaire, focusing on adherence to regulatory requirements and identifying areas where additional regulatory guidance may be beneficial. The findings indicate that the content of the overdosage sections largely comply with the regulatory requirements of their respective regions. Fewer than half of the labels included information on supratherapeutic doses observed from clinical studies, risk factors for overdose or population specific data associated with overdose. Inconsistencies were noted concerning the incorporation of animal data when human data were available, in addition to the referencing of Poison Centers. The overall utility of non-specific treatment recommendations, in addition to gastric lavage is discussed. While the content of the overdosage section generally aligns with regulatory expectations, additional regulatory guidance could enhance consistency in how this section of labeling is presented and clarify expectations to improve its usefulness for health care professionals (HCPs)."
38886371,In vitro evolution and whole genome analysis to study chemotherapy drug resistance in haploid human cells.,"In vitro evolution and whole genome analysis has proven to be a powerful method for studying the mechanism of action of small molecules in many haploid microbes but has generally not been applied to human cell lines in part because their diploid state complicates the identification of variants that confer drug resistance. To determine if haploid human cells could be used in MOA studies, we evolved resistance to five different anticancer drugs (doxorubicin, gemcitabine, etoposide, topotecan, and paclitaxel) using a near-haploid cell line (HAP1) and then analyzed the genomes of the drug resistant clones, developing a bioinformatic pipeline that involved filtering for high frequency alleles predicted to change protein sequence, or alleles which appeared in the same gene for multiple independent selections with the same compound. Applying the filter to sequences from 28 drug resistant clones identified a set of 21 genes which was strongly enriched for known resistance genes or known drug targets (TOP1, TOP2A, DCK, WDR33, SLCO3A1). In addition, some lines carried structural variants that encompassed additional known resistance genes (ABCB1, WWOX and RRM1). Gene expression knockdown and knockout experiments of 10 validation targets showed a high degree of specificity and accuracy in our calls and demonstrates that the same drug resistance mechanisms found in diverse clinical samples can be evolved, discovered and studied in an isogenic background."
38886370,A novel Hellinger distance-based regret theory method for spherical fuzzy decision making model and its application in logistics.,"Actual decision making problems are often based on the company decision maker's behavior factors, such as risk attitude, subjective preference, etc. Regret theory can well express the behavior of the decision maker. In this pursuit, a novel decision making method was developed, based on the regret theory for the multi-attribute decision making problem, in which attribute values were expressed by spherical fuzzy numbers. Distance measurement not only has extensive applications in fields such as pattern recognition and image processing, but also plays an important role in the research of fuzzy decision theory. The existing distance measures of spherical fuzzy set either have special cases of anti-intuition or are more complex in calculation, so finding suitable distance measures is also an important research topic in the decision-making theory of spherical fuzzy set. For this reason, we first establish a new distance of spherical fuzzy sets based on Hellinger distance of probability distribution. A decision maker's perception utility value function is proposed using the new distance formula, which is used to measure the regretful and rejoice value. Then we establish an optimization model for solving the attribute weights, when the information of attribute weight was partially known. Subsequently, the comprehensive perceived utility values were utilized to rank the order of the alternatives. Finally, a numerical example of assessment of logistics providers is used to show that the new decision making method is effective and feasible."
38887170,Single-Anion Conductive Solid-State Electrolytes with Hierarchical Ionic Highways for Flexible Zinc-Air Battery.,"Flexible zinc-air batteries are leading power sources for next-generation smart wearable electronics. However, flexible zinc-air batteries suffer from the highly-corrosive safety risk and limited lifespan due to the absence of reliable solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). Herein, a single-anion conductive SSE with high-safety is constructed by incorporating a highly amorphous dual-cation ionomer into a robust hybrid matrix of functional carbon nanotubes and polyacrylamide polymer. The as-fabricated SSE obtains dual-penetrating ionomer-polymer networks and hierarchical ionic highways, which contribute to mechanical robustness with 1200% stretchability, decent water uptake and retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 245 mS·cm-1 and good Zn anode reversibility. Remarkably, the flexible solid-state zinc-air batteries delivers a high specific capacity of 764 mAh·g-1 and peak power density of 152 mW·cm-2 as well as sustains excellent cycling stability for 1050 cycles (350 hours. This work offers a new paradigm of OH- conductors and broadens the definition and scope of OH- conductors."
38886510,Quantitative analysis of commercial coating penetration into Fagus crenata wood using X-ray microtomography.,"Recent advances in wood treatment include the use of eco-friendly coatings to improve the wood's dimensional stability and appearance. Assessing coating performance during its service life is critical for establishing a knowledge base for product optimization. Numerous approaches, including microimaging, are available for analyzing coating behavior. In addition to conventional microscopic techniques, high-resolution X-ray microtomography is a tool that provides nondestructive imaging of coatings and their substrates. In this study, we performed two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) visualization of tomographic reconstruction images of two coating types, spray and brush, to observe and assess the distribution of several commercial Japanese coating materials in Fagus crenata. X-ray images and plot profiles were used to determine the penetration depths and thicknesses of coatings. Each coated sample was scanned using X-ray microtomography, which allowed successful visualization and quantification of the coating penetration depth. Chemical content and concentration of the coating materials influenced penetration depth and amount."

38887561,OnabotulinumtoxinA is now an important tool for managing pediatric neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction.,"Initial urologic management of pediatric neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) includes clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) regimen and use of anticholinergic or beta3 agonist medications. Historically, NLUTD that did not respond to these initial management strategies received open surgical procedures such as augmentation cystoplasty (AC) to increase bladder capacity and create a lower-pressure reservoir. Since its first reported use in 2002, intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) injections has developed an emerging role in management of pediatric NLUTD, culminating in its recent FDA-approval in 2021. In this review, the current evidence regarding the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BTX-A use in pediatric NLUTD will be summarized. Additionally, we will attempt to define the current role of BTX-A in the management of patients with NLUTD, discuss limitations to the current body of literature, and suggest future avenues of study."
38886773,Insights into the role of mesenchymal stem cells in cutaneous medical aesthetics: from basics to clinics.,"With the development of the economy and the increasing prevalence of skin problems, cutaneous medical aesthetics are gaining more and more attention. Skin disorders like poor wound healing, aging, and pigmentation have an impact not only on appearance but also on patients with physical and psychological issues, and even impose a significant financial burden on families and society. However, due to the complexities of its occurrence, present treatment options cannot produce optimal outcomes, indicating a dire need for new and effective treatments. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secretomics treatment is a new regenerative medicine therapy that promotes and regulates endogenous stem cell populations and/or replenishes cell pools to achieve tissue homeostasis and regeneration. It has demonstrated remarkable advantages in several skin-related in vivo and in vitro investigations, aiding in the improvement of skin conditions and the promotion of skin aesthetics. As a result, this review gives a complete description of recent scientific breakthroughs in MSCs for skin aesthetics and the limitations of their clinical applications, aiming to provide new ideas for future research and clinical transformation."
38887261,"Socio-ecological impacts of extreme weather events in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya.","Climate change is expected to profoundly impact health and coping and widen social and environmental inequalities. People living in informal settlements are especially vulnerable to climate change as they are often located in ecologically sensitive areas more susceptible to extreme weather events (EWEs), such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. Women residing in informal settlements are especially vulnerable to climate change and related EWEs because they are more likely to experience worse health-related impacts than men but are less likely to have access to health-related services. Despite this inequality, there is a dearth of research that focuses on the impacts of EWEs on women in informal settlements. This study aims to explore the multidimensional impacts of EWEs on the daily lives of women in informal settlements through the lens of socio-ecological theory. Study data is from six monthly surveys (1 September 2022-28 February 2023) collected from a probability sample of 800 women living in two of the largest informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. This data is part of an ongoing longitudinal study that uses community participatory methods to investigate the effects of climate change on health and wellbeing in informal settlements by a team of 16 community health volunteers who lead data collection and provide expertise in ongoing analysis. Findings show profound impacts on women's health and wellbeing across individual, micro-, meso-, exo-, and macrosystems. These include physical and mental health, financial disruptions, property issues, social impacts, and impacts on their surrounding physical environment, such as disrupted food or water access, poor air quality, drainage issues, and safety concerns. In addition, findings highlight the critical importance of the chrono- and biosphere systems in research focused on the impacts of climate change and related EWEs among climate-vulnerable communities and marginalized populations within them."
38886457,Investigation on the influence of the skin tone on hyperspectral imaging for free flap surgery.,"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a new emerging modality useful for the noncontact assessment of free flap perfusion. This measurement technique relies on the optical properties within the tissue. Since the optical properties of hemoglobin (Hb) and melanin overlap, the results of the perfusion assessment and other tissue-specific parameters are likely to be distorted by the melanin, especially at higher melanin concentrations. Many spectroscopic devices have been shown to struggle with a melanin related bias, which results in a clinical need to improve non-invasive perfusion assessment, especially for a more pigmented population. This study investigated the influence of skin tones on tissue indices measurements using HSI. In addition, other factors that might affect HSI, such as age, body mass index (BMI), sex or smoking habits, were also considered. Therefore, a prospective feasibility study was conducted, including 101 volunteers from whom tissue indices measurements were performed on 16 different body sites. Skin tone classification was performed using the Fitzpatrick skin type classification questionnaire, and the individual typology angle (ITA) acquired from the RGB images was calculated simultaneously with the measurements. Tissue indices provided by the used HSI-device were correlated to the possible influencing factors. The results show that a dark skin tone and, therefore, higher levels of pigmentation influence the HSI-derived tissue indices. In addition, possible physiological factors influencing the HSI-measurements were found. In conclusion, the HSI-based tissue indices can be used for perfusion assessment for people with lighter skin tone levels but show limitations in people with darker skin tones. Furthermore, it could be used for a more individual perfusion assessment if different physiological influencing factors are respected."
38887158,Targeted genotyping-by-sequencing of potato and data analysis with R/polyBreedR.,"Mid-density targeted genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) combines trait-specific markers with thousands of genomic markers at an attractive price for linkage mapping and genomic selection. A 2.5K targeted GBS assay for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) was developed using the DArTag technology and later expanded to 4K targets. Genomic markers were selected from the potato Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to maximize genome coverage and polymorphism rates. The DArTag and SNP array platforms produced equivalent dendrograms in a test set of 298 tetraploid samples, and 83% of the common markers showed good quantitative agreement, with RMSE (root mean squared error) <0.5. DArTag is suited for genomic selection candidates in the clonal evaluation trial, coupled with imputation to a higher density platform for the training population. Using the software polyBreedR, an R package for the manipulation and analysis of polyploid marker data, the RMSE for imputation by linkage analysis was 0.15 in a small half-diallel population (N = 85), which was significantly lower than the RMSE of 0.42 with the random forest method. Regarding high-value traits, the DArTag markers for resistance to potato virus Y, golden cyst nematode, and potato wart appeared to track their targets successfully, as did multi-allelic markers for maturity and tuber shape. In summary, the potato DArTag assay is a transformative and publicly available technology for potato breeding and genetics."
38887947,Genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus analysis reveals silk-preferential gene regulatory network in maize.,"Silk of maize (Zea mays L.) contains diverse metabolites with complicated structures and functions, making it a great challenge to explore the mechanisms of metabolic regulation. Genome-wide identification of silk-preferential genes and investigation of their expression regulation provide an opportunity to reveal the regulatory networks of metabolism. Here, we applied the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping on a maize natural population to explore the regulation of gene expression in unpollinated silk of maize. We obtained 3,985 silk-preferential genes that were specifically or preferentially expressed in silk using our population. Silk-preferential genes showed more obvious expression variations compared with broadly expressed genes that were ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. We found that trans-eQTL regulation played a more important role for silk-preferential genes compared to the broadly expressed genes. The relationship between 38 transcription factors and 85 target genes, including silk-preferential genes, were detected. Finally, we constructed a transcriptional regulatory network around the silk-preferential gene Bx10, which was proposed to be associated with response to abiotic stress and biotic stress. Taken together, this study deepened our understanding of transcriptome variation in maize silk and the expression regulation of silk-preferential genes, enhancing the investigation of regulatory networks on metabolic pathways."
38887430,A case of pneumomediastinum complicating immunotherapy associated pneumonitis.,We describe the case of an 87-year-old gentleman referred to a metropolitan hospital in Sydney with pneumomediastinum complicating immunotherapy associated pneumonitis and recent bronchoscopic intervention. The contribution of pneumonitis in the setting of interstitial lung disease has been well described to developing pneumomediastinum however this is less clear in the setting of immunotherapy associated pneumonitis and to what extent bronchoscopic intervention compounds this risk.
38886283,SPEM1 Gene Mutation in a Case with Sperm Morphological Defects Leading to Male Infertility.,"The present study aimed at identifying the genetic mutation responsible for teratozoospermic infertility in a case with coiled sperm tails. A 33-year-old infertile male was diagnosed with teratozoospermic infertility, with sperm head in coiled (HIC) tail as the most common deformity. We employed whole exome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in this case. Exome sequencing data was filtered using the following criteria: MAF (< 0.003), ALFA project (< 0.001), 1000 Genomes (< 0.003), Granthem (> 50), Polyphen-2 (> 0.70), SIFT (< 0.03), and PhyloP (> = 0) scores. Shortlisted variants were looked in the in-house 29 exomes data available with us, and the variants that affected conserved amino acid residues or led to insertion/deletion or to protein-truncation with a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score ≥ 10 were shortlisted. The variants thus populated were prioritized according to their roles in spermiogenesis. The study identified a heterozygous mutation c.826C > T (Arg276Trp) in the SPEM1 gene as a potential pathogenic variant that led to teratozoospermic infertility in the case under investigation. The mutation had a minor allele frequency of 0.00008176 in the gnomAd database and was absent in the Indian Genome Variations database. This is the first human study reporting a mutation in the SPEM1 gene as a cause of coiled sperm tails."
38886864,"Assessing the quality of public services: For-profits, chains, and concentration in the hospital market.","We examine variation in US hospital quality across ownership, chain membership, and market concentration. We propose a new measure of quality derived from penalties imposed on hospitals under the flagship Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and use regression models to risk-adjust for hospital characteristics and county demographics. While the overall association between for-profit ownership and quality is negative, there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity. The quality of for-profit relative to non-profit hospitals declines with increasing market concentration. Moreover, the quality gap is primarily driven by for-profit chains. While the competition result mirrors earlier findings in the literature, the chain result appears to be new: it suggests that any potential quality gains afforded by chains are mostly realized by not-for-profit hospitals."
38885886,On the Speech Envelope in the Cortical Tracking of Speech.,"The synchronization between the speech envelope and neural activity in auditory regions, referred to as cortical tracking of speech (CTS), plays a key role in speech processing. The method selected for extracting the envelope is a crucial step in CTS measurement, and the absence of a consensus on best practices among the various methods can influence analysis outcomes and interpretation. Here, we systematically compare five standard envelope extraction methods the absolute value of Hilbert transform (absHilbert), gammatone filterbanks, heuristic approach, Bark scale, and vocalic energy), analyzing their impact on the CTS. We present performance metrics for each method based on the recording of brain activity from participants listening to speech in clear and noisy conditions, utilizing intracranial EEG, MEG and EEG data. As expected, we observed significant CTS in temporal brain regions below 10 Hz across all datasets, regardless of the extraction methods. In general, the gammatone filterbanks approach consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods. Results from our study can guide scientists in the field to make informed decisions about the optimal analysis to extract the CTS, contributing to advancing the understanding of the neuronal mechanisms implicated in CTS."

38885848,RIT2 regulates autophagy lysosomal pathway induction and protects against α-synuclein pathology in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease.,"Substantial work has been devoted to better understand the contribution of the myriad of genes that may underly the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and their role in disease etiology. The small GTPase Ras-like without CAAX2 (RIT2) is one such genetic risk factor, with one single nucleotide polymorphism in the RIT2 locus, rs12456492, having been associated with PD risk in multiple populations. While RIT2 has previously been shown to influence signaling pathways, dopamine transporter trafficking, and LRRK2 activity, its cellular function remains unclear. In the current study, we have situated RIT2 to be upstream of various diverse processes associated with PD. In cellular models, we have shown that RIT2 is necessary for activity-dependent changes in the expression of genes related to the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) by regulating the nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE3-family transcription factors. RIT2 is also associated with lysosomes and can regulate autophagic flux and clearance by regulating lysosomal hydrolase expression and activity. Interestingly, upregulation of RIT2 can augment ALP flux and protect against α-synuclein aggregation in cortical neurons. Taken together, the present study suggests that RIT2 can regulates gene expression upstream of ALP function and that enhancing RIT2 activity may provide therapeutic benefit in PD."
38887284,Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: the biology of a neglected disease.,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic, debilitating disease characterised by a wide range of symptoms that severely impact all aspects of life. Despite its significant prevalence, ME/CFS remains one of the most understudied and misunderstood conditions in modern medicine. ME/CFS lacks standardised diagnostic criteria owing to variations in both inclusion and exclusion criteria across different diagnostic guidelines, and furthermore, there are currently no effective treatments available. Moving beyond the traditional fragmented perspectives that have limited our understanding and management of the disease, our analysis of current information on ME/CFS represents a significant paradigm shift by synthesising the disease's multifactorial origins into a cohesive model. We discuss how ME/CFS emerges from an intricate web of genetic vulnerabilities and environmental triggers, notably viral infections, leading to a complex series of pathological responses including immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and metabolic disturbances. This comprehensive model not only advances our understanding of ME/CFS's pathophysiology but also opens new avenues for research and potential therapeutic strategies. By integrating these disparate elements, our work emphasises the necessity of a holistic approach to diagnosing, researching, and treating ME/CFS, urging the scientific community to reconsider the disease's complexity and the multifaceted approach required for its study and management."
38887581,Bismuth(III) triflate: an economical and environmentally friendly catalyst for the Nazarov reaction.,"We describe the use of bismuth(III) triflate as an efficient and environmentally friendly catalyst for the Nazarov reaction of aryl vinyl ketones, leading to the synthesis of 3-aryl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-1-indanones and 3-aryl-1-indanones. By changing the temperature and reaction time, it was possible to modulate the reactivity, allowing the synthesis of two distinct product classes (3-aryl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-1-indanones and 3-aryl-1-indanones) in good to excellent yield. The reaction did not require additives and was insensitive to both air and moisture. Preliminary biological evaluation of some indanones showed a promising profile against some human cancer line cells."
38886829,Retroviral PBS-segment sequence and structure: Orchestrating early and late replication events.,"An essential regulatory hub for retroviral replication events, the 5' untranslated region (UTR) encodes an ensemble of cis-acting replication elements that overlap in a logical manner to carry out divergent RNA activities in cells and in virions. The primer binding site (PBS) and primer activation sequence initiate the reverse transcription process in virions, yet overlap with structural elements that regulate expression of the complex viral proteome. PBS-segment also encompasses the attachment site for Integrase to cut and paste the 3' long terminal repeat into the host chromosome to form the provirus and purine residues necessary to execute the precise stoichiometry of genome-length transcripts and spliced viral RNAs. Recent genetic mapping, cofactor affinity experiments, NMR and SAXS have elucidated that the HIV-1 PBS-segment folds into a three-way junction structure. The three-way junction structure is recognized by the host's nuclear RNA helicase A/DHX9 (RHA). RHA tethers host trimethyl guanosine synthase 1 to the Rev/Rev responsive element (RRE)-containing RNAs for m7-guanosine Cap hyper methylation that bolsters virion infectivity significantly. The HIV-1 trimethylated (TMG) Cap licenses specialized translation of virion proteins under conditions that repress translation of the regulatory proteins. Clearly host-adaption and RNA shapeshifting comprise the fundamental basis for PBS-segment orchestrating both reverse transcription of virion RNA and the nuclear modification of m7G-Cap for biphasic translation of the complex viral proteome. These recent observations, which have exposed even greater complexity of retroviral RNA biology than previously established, are the impetus for this article. Basic research to fully comprehend the marriage of PBS-segment structures and host RNA binding proteins that carry out retroviral early and late replication events is likely to expose an immutable virus-specific therapeutic target to attenuate retrovirus proliferation."
38887408,Integrating the Teaching and Assessment of Moral Reasoning into Undergraduate Medical Education to Advance Health Equity.,"Moral reasoning skills among medical students have regressed despite the implementation of ethics teachings in medical education curricula. This inability to retain moral reasoning capability is attributed to difficulty transitioning to the principled thinking stage of moral reasoning as well as worsening of ethical decision-making skills during clerkship education due to the ""hidden curriculum."" Prior studies have examined the efficacy of individual strategies for moral education, but there is insufficient analysis comparing multiple educational interventions and moral reasoning assessment tools. The role and impact of these instruments in medical curricula for the advancement of health equity is reviewed."
38887946,Nonpharmacological Approaches to Managing Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common subtype of heart failure marked by impaired left ventricular diastolic function and decreased myocardial compliance. Given the limited availability of evidence-based pharmacological treatments for HFpEF, there is a growing interest in nonpharmacological interventions as viable therapeutic alternatives. This review aims to explore the pathophysiology of HFpEF and present recent advancements in nonpharmacological management approaches, encompassing noninvasive therapies, invasive procedures and targeted treatments for comorbidities. An extensive literature review was undertaken to identify and synthesize emerging nonpharmacological treatment options for HFpEF, assessing their potential to enhance patient outcomes. Nonpharmacological strategies, such as vagus nerve stimulation, percutaneous pulmonary artery denervation, renal denervation, transcatheter insertion of atrial shunts and pericardial resection, demonstrate promising potential for alleviating HFpEF symptoms and improving patient prognosis. Moreover, addressing comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, may offer additional therapeutic benefits. These cutting-edge techniques, in conjunction with well-established exercise therapies, pave the way for future research and clinical applications in the field. Nonpharmacological interventions hold promise for advancing HFpEF patient care and fostering a deeper understanding of these treatment approaches, which will facilitate new clinical applications and contribute to the development of more targeted therapies."
38887844,On the prospects of longtermism.,"This article objects to two arguments that William MacAskill gives in What We Owe the Future in support of optimism about the prospects of longtermism, that is, the prospects of positively influencing the longterm future. First, it grants that he is right that, whereas humans sometimes benefit others as an end, they rarely harm them as an end, but argues that this bias towards positive motivation is counteracted by the fact that it is practically easier to harm than to benefit. For this greater easiness makes it likely both that accidental effects will be harmful rather than beneficial and that the means or side-effects of the actions people perform with the aim of benefiting themselves and those close to them will tend to be harmful to others. Secondly, while our article agrees with him that values could lock-in, it contends that the value of longtermism is unlikely to lock in as long as human beings have not been morally enhanced but remain partial in favor of themselves and those near and dear."
38885888,The interplay of oxytocin and sex hormones.,"The neuropeptide oxytocin has historically been associated with reproduction and maternal behavior. However, more recent research has uncovered that oxytocin has a much wider range of roles in physiology and behavior. Despite the excitement surrounding potential therapeutical applications of intranasally administered oxytocin, the results of these intervention studies have been inconsistent. Various reasons for these mixed results have been proposed, which tend to focus on methodological issues, such as study design. While methodological issues are certainly important, emerging evidence suggests that the interaction between oxytocin and sex hormones may also account for these varied findings. To better understand the purpose and function of the interaction of oxytocin with sex hormones, with a focus on estrogens, progesterone, and testosterone, we conducted a comprehensive thematic review via four perspectives: evolutionary, developmental, mechanistic, and survival. Altogether, this synergistic approach highlights the critical function of sex hormone activity for accomplishing the diverse roles of oxytocin via the modulation of oxytocin release and oxytocin receptor activity, which is also likely to contribute to the heterogeneity of outcomes after oxytocin administration."
38887989,Digest: Resource limitation as a mechanism for constraining the evolution of virulence in malaria parasites.,"The virulence of parasites is expected to reflect an evolutionary tradeoff between increasing proliferation rates that enhance transmission and host mortality which curtails transmission. However, host resource availability may also limit parasites' proliferation rate. To understand the role of resource limitation as a driver of virulence evolution, Pak et al. (2024) use a within-host model of red blood cell (RBC) invasion by Plasmodium chabaudi. They find that within-host resource consumption limits the evolution of the parasite's proliferation rate, as the depletion of RBCs during infection results in intermediate optimal virulence. These results suggest that resource limitation, rather than host mortality, may drive the evolution of virulence."
38887323,Preparation and Characterization of Ferulic Acid Hydrogel and Its Application as a Local Drug Delivery Agent in Periodontitis.,"Introduction Periodontitis, a persistent inflammatory condition, impacts the tissues supporting teeth. Beyond mechanically eradicating the biofilm, additional host-modulating agents can aid in the treatment of periodontitis. Among these, gels are a very popular choice for use in the field of dentistry as these systems boast high biocompatibility and bioadhesiveness. These qualities make them easily administered and fabricated. They are typically placed into the periodontal site via wide-port needle syringes. Many investigations have demonstrated that hydrogels possess the ability for controlled drug release and aid in periodontal wound healing. Hence, this study aimed to develop a ferulic acid hydrogel and assess its effectiveness for managing periodontitis. Materials and methods Ferulic acid hydrogel was prepared followed by haemolysis assay and biocompatibility assay. After the in vitro analysis, a clinical trial was conducted: 20 patients were divided into Group A (comprising patients in whom scaling and root planing (SRP) was done) and Group B (comprising patients in whom SRP along with hydrogel application was done). Each patient's pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI) were recorded at baseline and at three months. Intergroup and intragroup comparisons of the parameters were made. Results Ferulic acid hydrogels exhibit a minimal ratio of red blood cell destruction, indicating their low haemolytic activity. Beyond 94 hours, ferulic acid hydrogel demonstrates minimal toxicity towards human fibroblasts, suggesting it has good biocompatibility. When clinical parameters were compared after three months of treatment with SRP alone, significant reductions were observed in all parameters. However, when hydrogel application was done along with SRP, greater reduction was seen in terms of all clinical parameters indicating the efficacy of the ferulic acid hydrogel as an adjunct.  Conclusion Ferulic acid has distinct haemolytic activity as well as good biocompatibility. Its use also led to a considerable reduction in all clinical parameters, necessitating its role as a local drug delivery agent in the treatment of periodontitis."
38887519,Exploiting cell death and tumor immunity in cancer therapy: challenges and future directions.,"Cancer remains a significant global challenge, with escalating incidence rates and a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Herein, we present an in-depth exploration of the intricate interplay between cancer cell death pathways and tumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment (TME). We begin by elucidating the epidemiological landscape of cancer, highlighting its pervasive impact on premature mortality and the pronounced burden in regions such as Asia and Africa. Our analysis centers on the pivotal concept of immunogenic cell death (ICD), whereby cancer cells succumbing to specific stimuli undergo a transformation that elicits robust anti-tumor immune responses. We scrutinize the mechanisms underpinning ICD induction, emphasizing the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as key triggers for dendritic cell (DC) activation and subsequent T cell priming. Moreover, we explore the contributions of non-apoptotic RCD pathways, including necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, to tumor immunity within the TME. Emerging evidence suggests that these alternative cell death modalities possess immunogenic properties and can synergize with conventional treatments to bolster anti-tumor immune responses. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic implications of targeting the TME for cancer treatment, highlighting strategies to harness immunogenic cell death and manipulate non-apoptotic cell death pathways for therapeutic benefit. By elucidating the intricate crosstalk between cancer cell death and immune modulation within the TME, this review aims to pave the way for the development of novel cancer therapies that exploit the interplay between cell death mechanisms and tumor immunity and overcome Challenges in the Development and implementation of Novel Therapies."
38886928,Unravelling inter-relations within and between psychodynamic constructs and psychopathology using network analysis.,"Psychodynamic constructs and psychopathology are closely inter-related, but more detailed insight is needed. We investigated these complex inter-relations using network analysis. A Gaussian graphical model in a sample of N = 2232 psychotherapeutic inpatients was estimated. Self-administered questionnaires to assess interpersonal relations (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-32), psychodynamic conflicts (Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis-Conflict Questionnaire), personality functioning (Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis-Structure Questionnaire-Short Form, Inventory of Personality Organization-Short Form), and psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory) were utilized. We investigated the network structure, identified the most inter-related psychodynamic constructs and the psychodynamic constructs with the strongest inter-relations to psychopathology, and explored the clustering of all included constructs. Active and passive conflict processing modes were negatively inter-related in most conflicts. Passive conflict processing modes were more strongly related to psychopathology than active ones in all conflicts, apart from the care versus autarky conflict. Identity diffusion shared the strongest inter-relations within psychodynamic constructs. The psychodynamic constructs that were most strongly related to psychopathology were impairments in self-perception and the passive self-worth conflict. Psychopathology and psychodynamic constructs formed distinct clusters. Our results emphasize the relevance of personality functioning within psychodynamic constructs and in relation to psychopathology."
38886526,Spatial prioritization of dugong habitats in India can contribute towards achieving the 30 × 30 global biodiversity target.,"Indian coastal waters are critical for dugong populations in the western Indian Ocean. Systematic spatial planning of dugong habitats can help to achieve biodiversity conservation and area-based protection targets in the region. In this study, we employed environmental niche modelling to predict suitable dugong habitats and identify influencing factors along its entire distribution range in Indian waters. We examined data on fishing pressures collected through systematic interview surveys, citizen-science data, and field surveys to demarcate dugong habitats with varying risks. Seagrass presence was the primary factor in determining dugong habitat suitability across the study sites. Other variables such as depth, bathymetric slope, and Euclidean distance from the shore were significant factors, particularly in predicting seasonal suitability. Predicted suitable habitats showed a remarkable shift from pre-monsoon in Palk Bay to post-monsoon in the Gulf of Mannar, indicating the potential of seasonal dugong movement. The entire coastline along the Palk Bay-Gulf of Mannar region was observed to be at high to moderate risk, including the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, a high-risk area. The Andaman Islands exhibited high suitability during pre- and post-monsoon season, whereas the Nicobar Islands were highly suitable for monsoon season. Risk assessment of modelled suitable areas revealed that < 15% of high-risk areas across Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar, Tamil Nadu, fall within the existing protected areas. A few offshore reef islands are identified under high-risk zones in the Gulf of Kutch, Gujarat. We highlight the utility of citizen science and secondary data in performing large-scale spatial ecological analysis. Overall, identifying synoptic scale 'Critical Dugong Habitats' has positive implications for the country's progress towards achieving the global 30 × 30 target through systematic conservation planning."
38886822,"Inhibition of cortical synaptic transmission, behavioral nociceptive, and anxiodepressive-like responses by arecoline in adult mice.","Areca nut, the seed of Areca catechu L., is one of the most widely consumed addictive substances in the world after nicotine, ethanol, and caffeine. The major effective constituent of A. catechu, arecoline, has been reported to affect the central nervous system. Less is known if it may affect pain and its related emotional responses. In this study, we found that oral application of arecoline alleviated the inflammatory pain and its induced anxiolytic and anti-depressive-like behavior. Arecoline also increased the mechanical nociceptive threshold and alleviated depression-like behavior in naïve mice. In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which acts as a hinge of nociception and its related anxiety and depression, by using the multi-electrode field potential recording and whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we found that the evoked postsynaptic transmission in the ACC of adult mice has been inhibited by the application of arecoline. The muscarinic receptor is the major receptor of the arecoline in the ACC. Our results suggest that arecoline alleviates pain, anxiety, and depression-like behavior in both physiological and pathological conditions, and this new mechanism may help to treat patients with chronic pain and its related anxiety and disorder in the future."
38887807,Surgical Treatment of Ruptured Aneurysms of Lateral Spinal Artery Presenting as Intracranial Subarachnoid Hemorrhage : Case Series and Literature Review.,"Lateral spinal artery (LSA) aneurysms are extremely rare lesions that can rupture and cause subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) even though the spinal arteries communicate directly with the subarachnoid space. To date, six cases of LSA aneurysms have been reported in the literature. (Table 1) Herein, three such cases are reported. All patients presented to the emergency department with headaches. The patients in the first two cases were confirmed to have SAH and LSA aneurysms on a brain computed tomography (CT) angiography performed at the hospital. Two patients had prior instances of cerebral infarction and coronary disease, respectively, and were undergoing antiplatelet therapy. The antiplatelet medication was halted for 2 weeks and 1 weeks, respectively, while conservative care was provided. Subsequently, a suboccipital craniectomy was performed, followed by aneurysm clipping. Following the surgery, both patients were discharged without any significant neurological deficits. Regarding the third patient, no aneurysm was found on brain CT angiography, and cerebral angiography was performed during the patient's hospital stay. She was hospitalized, where she received medication and conservative care, and was discharged with an improvement in bleeding without neurological symptoms. Subsequently, an LSA aneurysm was identified on a brain CT angiography performed at an outpatient clinic; however, the patient opted for treatment and was transferred to another hospital. LSA aneurysms are difficult to visualize using CT angiography; therefore, careful angiographic studies are required. Surgical clipping is the treatment of choice if the aneurysm is inaccessible by the endovascular treatment."
38886397,Co-pyrolysis of chicken manure with tree bark for reduced biochar toxicity and enhanced plant growth in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Co-pyrolysis of chicken manure with tree bark was investigated to mitigate salinity and potentially toxic element (PTE) concentrations of chicken manure-derived biochar. The effect of tree bark addition (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 wt%) on the biochar composition, surface functional groups, PTEs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentration in the biochar was evaluated. Biochar-induced toxicity was assessed using an in-house plant growth assay with Arabidopsis thaliana. This study shows that PTE concentrations can be controlled through co-pyrolysis. More than 50 wt% of tree bark must be added to chicken manure to reduce the concentrations below the European Biochar Certificate-AGRO (EBC-AGRO) threshold. However, the amount of PAH does not show a trend with tree bark addition. Furthermore, co-pyrolysis biochar promotes plant growth at different application concentrations, whereas pure application of 100 wt% tree bark or chicken manure biochar results in decreased growth compared to the reference. In addition, increased plant stress was observed for 100 wt% chicken manure biochar. These data indicate that co-pyrolysis of chicken manure and tree bark produces EBC-AGRO-compliant biochar with the potential to stimulate plant growth. Further studies need to assess the effect of these biochars in long-term growth experiments."
38886916,Influence of Nurses' Perceptions of Government Policies and COVID-19 Risks on Their Mental Health Status: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Study.,"This study aimed to understand nurses' perceptions of COVID-19-related policies and risks during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hong Kong and to determine how their perceptions influenced their mental health status. A web-based online survey among Hong Kong nurses was conducted. The questionnaire included a self-designed 5-point Likert scale with 17 items to assess the nurses' perceptions of COVID-19-related policies and risks, as well as the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD) for measurement of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), stress, depression and anxiety, respectively. Of 592 nurses enrolled, 30.6% had PTSD (DTS total score ≥40), and 80.4%, 19.9% and 16.4% had moderate-to-high levels of stress (PSS-10 score ≥14), depression (PHQ-2 score ≥3) and anxiety (GAD score ≥3), respectively. The top three concerned aspects were 'worried about themselves and friends to suffer this disease' (84.5%), 'insufficient number of isolation wards' (81.8%) and 'insufficient number of personal protective equipment' (74.3%). Logistic regression analyses showed that more negative perception on 'personal protective equipment in the healthcare institutions', 'the confidence in HK's control of COVID-19', 'worried about themselves and friends to suffer this disease' and 'self-perceived risk of infection' indicated higher severity of the four mental health problems (all p < 0.01). The perception on 'public gathering ban', 'the number of isolation wards' and 'expected time to control COVID-19' were significantly associated with PTSD and stress (all p < 0.05). Nurses' perception on government policies and COVID-19 risks played an important role in predicting their mental health status. Policy makers should be aware of nurses' psychological responses and provide timely and targeted emotional support to nurses amid and after the COVID-19 pandemic."
38887795,Mapping the Geographical Distribution of the Mucosa-Associated Gut Microbiome in GI-Symptomatic Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and communication impairments. In the last few years, it has been proposed that alterations in the gut microbiota may contribute to an aberrant communication between the gut and brain in children with ASD. Consistent with this notion, several studies have demonstrated that children with ASD have an altered fecal microbiota compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, it is unclear where along the length of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract these alterations in microbial communities occur. Additionally, the variation between specific mucosa-associated communities remains unknown. To address this gap in knowledge of the microbiome associated with ASD, biopsies from the antrum, duodenum, ileum, ascending colon, and rectum of children with ASD and age- and sex-matched TD children were examined by 16s rRNA sequencing. We observed an overall elevated abundance of Bacillota and Bacteroidota and decreased abundance of Pseudomonadota in all GI tract regions of both male and female ASD children compared to TD children. Further analysis at the genera level revealed unique differences in the microbiome in the different regions of the GI tract in ASD children compared to TD children. We also observed sex-specific differences in the gut microbiota composition in children with ASD. These data indicate that the microbiota of ASD children is altered at multiple regions of the GI tract and that different anatomic locations have unique alterations in mucosa-associated bacterial genera."
38887909,Nanomaterials as a Service (NaaS) concept: on-demand protocols for volume synthesis of nanomaterials.,"Establishing scalable nanomaterials synthesis protocols remains a bottleneck towards their commercialisation and, thus, a topic of intense research and development. Herein, we present an automated machine-learning microfluidic platform capable of synthesising optically active nanomaterials from target spectra originating from prior experience, theorised or published. Implementing unsupervised Bayesian optimisation with Gaussian processes reduces the optimisation time and the need for prior knowledge to initiate the process. Using PTFE tubing and connectors enables facile change in reactor design. Ultimately, the platform substitutes the labour-intensive trial-and-error synthesis and provides a pathway to standardisation and volume synthesis, slowing down the translation and commercialisation of high-quality nanomaterials. As a proof-of-concept, Ag nanoplates and Prussian-blue nanoparticle protocols were optimised and validated for volume production."
38886898,The emerging role of targeted protein degradation to treat and study cancer.,"The evolution of cancer treatment has provided increasingly targeted strategies both in the upfront and relapsed disease settings. Small-molecule inhibitors and immunotherapy have risen to prominence with chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, checkpoint inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and monoclonal antibody therapies being deployed across a range of solid organ and haematological malignancies. However, novel approaches are required to target transcription factors and oncogenic fusion proteins that are central to cancer biology and have generally eluded successful drug development. Thalidomide analogues causing protein degradation have been a cornerstone of treatment in multiple myeloma, but a lack of in-depth mechanistic understanding initially limited progress in the field. When the protein cereblon (CRBN) was found to mediate thalidomide analogues' action and CRBN's neo-targets were identified, existing and novel drug development accelerated, with applications outside multiple myeloma, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute leukaemias. Critically, transcription factors were the first canonical targets described. In addition to broadening the application of protein-degrading drugs, resistance mechanisms are being overcome and targeted protein degradation is widening the scope of druggable proteins against which existing approaches have been ineffective. Examples of targeted protein degraders include molecular glues and proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs): heterobifunctional molecules that bind to proteins of interest and cause proximity-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via a linked E3 ligase. Twenty years since their inception, PROTACs have begun progressing through clinical trials, with early success in targeting the oestrogen receptor and androgen receptor in breast and prostate cancer respectively. This review explores important developments in targeted protein degradation to both treat and study cancer. It also considers the potential advantages and challenges in the translational aspects of developing new treatments. © 2024 The Author(s).

38886959,Pro-resolving lipid mediator reduces amyloid-β42-induced gene expression in human monocyte-derived microglia.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202503000-00031/figure1/v/2024-06-17T092413Z/r/image-tiff Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators including maresin 1 mediate resolution but the levels of these are reduced in Alzheimer's disease brain, suggesting that they constitute a novel target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease to prevent/stop inflammation and combat disease pathology. Therefore, it is important to clarify whether they counteract the expression of genes and proteins induced by amyloid-β. With this objective, we analyzed the relevance of human monocyte-derived microglia for in vitro modeling of neuroinflammation and its resolution in the context of Alzheimer's disease and investigated the pro-resolving bioactivity of maresin 1 on amyloid-β42-induced Alzheimer's disease-like inflammation. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data and secreted proteins in supernatants from the monocyte-derived microglia showed that the monocyte-derived microglia resembled Alzheimer's disease-like neuroinflammation in human brain microglia after incubation with amyloid-β42. Maresin 1 restored homeostasis by down-regulating inflammatory pathway related gene expression induced by amyloid-β42 in monocyte-derived microglia, protection of maresin 1 against the effects of amyloid-β42 is mediated by a re-balancing of inflammatory transcriptional networks in which modulation of gene transcription in the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway plays a major part. We pinpointed molecular targets that are associated with both neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and therapeutic targets by maresin 1. In conclusion, monocyte-derived microglia represent a relevant in vitro microglial model for studies on Alzheimer's disease-like inflammation and drug response for individual patients. Maresin 1 ameliorates amyloid-β42-induced changes in several genes of importance in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease."
38887825,Characteristics of board-certified pediatric dermatologists accepting Medicaid.,"A current shortage of pediatric dermatologists limits access to dermatologic care among the pediatric population, yet comprehensive and updated data are lacking regarding access among the pediatric Medicaid population. This cross-sectional study characterized Medicaid acceptance among actively practicing board-certified pediatric dermatologists in the United States and revealed that of the 352 physicians compiled, 275 (78.1%) accept Medicaid. Significant differences in Medicaid acceptance status were observed based on practice type, region of practice, practice county median household income, and density of pediatric dermatologists. While the majority of practicing board-certified pediatric dermatologists accept Medicaid, our findings suggest that differences in access to Medicaid-accepting pediatric dermatologists exist based on practice type, geographic location, and density of pediatric dermatologists per county."

38887343,Role of Polyetheretherketone in Prosthodontics: A Literature Review.,"Implant prostheses and other fixed and removable metal prostheses have led to an increase in demand for the development of new and efficient materials such as high-performance polymers polyetheretherketone (PEEK) over titanium and other metals because of their further complications in the human body. PEEK is a polymer that is nontoxic and has a modulus of elasticity that is comparable to that of human bone. PEEK implants provide benefits over metal implants, such as reducing the stress shielding effect, simple processing, and color resemblance to natural teeth. And it is a fantastic alternative to titanium for dental and orthopedic implants. The current review is undertaken to understand the properties of this PEEK material to weigh its benefits and drawbacks for potential use in dental implants and other prostheses."

38887036,Multiscale analysis of triglycerides using X-ray scattering: implementing a shape-dependent model for CNP characterization.,"In the last decade, research has focused on examining the fundamental interactions occurring in triglycerides, aiming to comprehend the self-assembly of crystalline nanoplatelets (CNPs) and their role in forming larger hierarchical structures essential for fat functionality. Microscopy research on CNPs frequently requires disruptive preparatory techniques, such as deoiling and sonication, to achieve quantitative outcomes. Conversely, X-ray scattering has proven to be an advantageous method for studying triglycerides, as little sample is needed to quantify the system's hierarchical structures. Specifically, ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) has emerged as a fitting technique for studying CNPs, owing to its length scale range falling between 25 nm and 3.49 μm. In this study, we characterized four different 30% fat dilutions of stearic acid-based fats in triolein, with various purities and preparation protocols. Samples were characterized by combining diverse microscopy techniques (cryo-SEM, TEM, polarized light and phase contrast microscopy) with synchrotron-radiation X-ray scattering (WAXS, SAXS, and USAXS). A shape-dependent model for the interpretation of USAXS data is proposed, overcoming some of the drawbacks linked to previously utilized models. CNPs are modeled as polydisperse parallelepipeds, and the aggregates are characterized by fractal dimensionality. This model offers novel insights into CNP cross-section, as well as aggregation. In the long run, we hope that the model will increase our understanding of CNP conformation and interactions, helping us design new fat systems on the mesoscale."

38885940,Synergistic Effects of the Superhydrophilic and Superhydrophobic Components on the Anti-freezing Performances of Latex Particles and Anti-icing Properties of Latex Films.,"The development of new materials for anti-freezing and anti-icing applications is a big challenge in industry and academic area. In this research, inspired by the antifreeze proteins, latex particles with superhydrophilic zwitterionic shells and superhydrophobic cores are synthesized by RAFT emulsion polymerization, and the applications of the latex particles in anti-freezing and anti-icing applications are investigated. In anti-freezing study, the critical aggregate temperature (CAT) of the latex particles decreases, and the separation of the melting and freezing temperature of ice increases with the particle concentration. Enzyme molecules can be cryopreserved in the presence of the latex particles; and their bioactivities are well maintained. Latex particles are casted into latex films with dynamic surfaces. Anti-icing performances including anti-frosting properties, freezing delay time and ice adhesion strengths, are studied; and the water-treated latex films present stronger anti-icing properties than other films, due to the synergistic effects of the superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic components. In addition, latex particles with zwitterionic shells and poly(n-butyl methacrylate) cores, and latex particles with small molecular surfactant on the surfaces are synthesized, respectively. The anti-freezing performances of the different latex particles and anti-icing properties of the latex films are compared. This research provides a facile and effective method for the synthesis of anti-freezing and anti-icing materials. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
38886455,Development of a predictive nomogram for in-hospital death risk in multimorbid patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing Palliative Locoregional Therapy.,"Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often present with multimorbidity, significantly contributing to adverse outcomes, particularly in-hospital mortality. This study aimed to develop a predictive nomogram to assess the impact of comorbidities on in-hospital mortality risk in HCC patients undergoing palliative locoregional therapy. We retrospectively analyzed data from 345 hospitalized HCC patients who underwent palliative locoregional therapy between January 2015 and December 2022. The nomogram was constructed using independent risk factors such as length of stay (LOS), hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), N stage, and microvascular invasion. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy with an AUC of 0.908 (95% CI: 0.859-0.956) for the overall dataset, 0.926 (95% CI: 0.883-0.968) for the training set, and 0.862 (95% CI: 0.728-0.994) for the validation set. Calibration curves indicated a strong correlation between predicted and observed outcomes, validated by statistical tests. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves (CIC) confirmed the model's clinical utility in predicting in-hospital mortality. This nomogram offers a practical tool for personalized risk assessment in HCC patients undergoing palliative locoregional therapy, facilitating informed clinical decision-making and improving patient management."
38887671,The need for a change in medical research thinking. Eco-systemic research frames are better suited to explore patterned disease behaviors.,"Many practicing physicians struggle to properly evaluate clinical research studies - they either simply do not know them, regard the reported findings as 'truth' since they were reported in a 'reputable' journal and blindly implement these interventions, or they disregard them as having little pragmatic impact or relevance to their daily clinical work. Three aspects for the latter are highlighted: study populations rarely reflect their practice population, the absolute average benefits on specific outcomes in most controlled studies, while statistically significant, are so small that they are pragmatically irrelevant, and overall mortality between the intervention and control groups are unaffected. These observations underscore the need to rethink our research approaches in the clinical context - moving from the predominant reductionist to an eco-systemic research approach will lead to knowledge better suited to clinical decision-making for an individual patient as it takes into account the complex interplay of multi-level variables that impact health outcomes in the real-world setting."
38887010,Implementation and Evaluation of Discharge Planning for Patients Undergoing Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation.,"BACKGROUND Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) patients have high rates of unplanned readmissions and poor quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of discharge planning on unplanned readmissions, self-efficacy, QoL, and clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients who received their first UCBT from April 2022 to March 2023 were included. Participants (n=72) were assigned to a control group (CG: received usual care) or an intervention group (IG: received discharge planning from admission to 100 days after UCBT). The cumulative readmission rates 30 days after discharge and 100 days after UCBT were analyzed using the log-rank test. Self-efficacy and QoL were assessed at admission and 100 days after UCBT using the General Self-Efficacy Scale and FACT-BMT version 4, clinical outcomes derived from medical records. RESULTS Sixty-six patients completed the study. Discharge planning did not reduce readmission rates 30 days after discharge (20.59% vs 31.25%, P=0.376) or 100 days after UCBT (29.41% vs 34.38%, P=0.629). However, the IG showed significantly better self-efficacy (P<0.001), and except for social and emotional well-being, all the other dimensions and 3 total scores of FACT-BMT in the IG were higher than for the controls at 100 days after UCBT (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The discharge planning program can improve self-efficacy and QoL of UCBT recipients. The implementation of discharge planning for patients undergoing UCBT was necessary for successful hospital-to-home transitions."

38886327,Treadmill Exercise Enhances Post-Stroke Functional Recovery in Mice via the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 Signaling Pathway.,"To validate that treadmill exercise promotes neurofunctional recovery post ischemic stroke and to specifically explore the role of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling pathway in this treadmill-mediated recovery process. C57BL/6 J mice were used to establish a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. From days 5 to 28 post-stroke, the experimental group did 10-min treadmill sessions twice daily at 12 r/min; the control group remained inactive. On day 6 post-stroke, mice received three intraperitoneal injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or PBS. On days 1, 3, and 5 post-stroke, mice received intracerebroventricular injections of exogenous recombinant CX3CL1, CX3CL1 antagonist, or PBS. The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and the corner test were used to assess sensorimotor function, and the morris water maze (MWM) test was employed to evaluate cognitive function. Western blot detected CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 protein expression, while immunofluorescence observed these proteins, neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ), rostral migratory stream (RMS), and dentate gyrus (DG), along with Iba1 and CD68 co-expression. ELISA quantified IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-10 levels. Treadmill exercise significantly improved neurofunctional recovery in MCAO mice, enhanced neurogenesis in the RMS and SVZ, and increased the expression of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1. The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis enhanced the impact of treadmill exercise on neurofunctional recovery, promoting neurogenesis in the RMS and SVZ, and reducing inflammation. Additionally, this axis also enhanced neurogenesis and suppressed microglial activation in the DG induced by treadmill exercise. This study demonstrates the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pathway as critical for treadmill-induced post-stroke recovery, indicating its potential target for exercise mimetics in rehabilitation."
38886738,Mitotic kinases are emerging therapeutic targets against metastatic breast cancer.,"This review aims to outline mitotic kinase inhibitors' roles as potential therapeutic targets and assess their suitability as a stand-alone clinical therapy or in combination with standard treatments for advanced-stage solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Breast cancer poses a significant global health risk, with TNBC standing out as the most aggressive subtype. Comprehending the role of mitosis is crucial for understanding how TNBC advances from a solid tumor to metastasis. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment used to treat TNBC. Some types of chemotherapeutic agents target cells in mitosis, thus highlighting the need to comprehend the molecular mechanisms governing mitosis in cancer. This understanding is essential for devising targeted therapies to disrupt these mitotic processes, prevent or treat metastasis, and improve patient outcomes. Mitotic kinases like Aurora kinase A, Aurora Kinase B, never in mitosis gene A-related kinase 2, Threonine-Tyrosine kinase, and Polo-kinase 1 significantly impact cell cycle progression by contributing to chromosome separation and centrosome homeostasis. When these kinases go awry, they can trigger chromosome instability, increase cell proliferation, and activate different molecular pathways that culminate in a transition from epithelial to mesenchymal cells. Ongoing clinical trials investigate various mitotic kinase inhibitors as potential biological treatments against advanced solid tumors. While clinical trials against mitotic kinases have shown some promise in the clinic, more investigation is necessary, since they induce severe adverse effects, particularly affecting the hematopoietic system."
38887937,Transcription factor OsNF-YC1 regulates grain size by coordinating the transcriptional activation of OsMADS1 in Oryza sativa L.,"Grain weight, grain number per panicle, and the number of panicles are the three factors that determine rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield. Of these, grain weight, which not only directly determines rice yield but also influences appearance and quality, is often considered the most important for rice production. Here, we describe OsNF-YC1, a member of the NF-Y transcription factor family that regulates rice grain size. OsNF-YC1 knockout plants (osnf-yc1), obtained using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, showed reduced grain weight due to reduced width and thickness, with no change in grain length, leading to a slenderer grain shape. Downregulation of OsNF-YC1 using RNA interference resulted in similar grain phenotypes as osnf-yc1. OsNF-YC1 affects grain formation by regulating both cell proliferation and cell expansion. OsNF-YC1 localizes in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, has transcriptional activation activity at both the N-terminus and C-terminus, and is highly expressed in young panicles. OsNF-YC1 interacts with OsMADS1 both in vivo and in vitro. Further analysis showed that the histone-like structural CBFD-NFYB-HMF domain of OsNF-YC1 conserved in the OsNF-YC transcription factor family can directly interact with the MADS-box domain of OsMADS1 to enhance its transcriptional activation activity. This interaction positively regulates the expression of OsMADS55, the direct downstream target of OsMADS1. Therefore, this paper reveals a potential grain size regulation pathway controlled by an OsNF-YC1-OsMADS1-OsMADS55 module in rice."
38888038,Discovery of a Double-Stapled Short Peptide as a Long-Acting HIV-1 Inactivator with Potential for Oral Bioavailability.,"Different from most antiretroviral drugs that act as passive defenders to inhibit HIV-1 replication inside the host cell, virus inactivators can attack and inactivate HIV-1 virions without relying on their replication cycle. Herein, we describe the discovery of a hydrocarbon double-stapled helix peptide, termed D26. D26 is based on the HIV-1 gp41 protein lentiviral lytic peptide-3 motif (LLP3) sequence, which can efficiently inhibit HIV-1 infection and inactivate cell-free HIV-1 virions. It was noted that D26 was highly resistant to proteolytic degradation and exhibited a remarkably extended in vivo elimination half-life. Additionally, relative to its linear, nonstapled version, D26 exhibited much higher exposure in sanctuary sites for HIV-1. Amazingly, this lead compound also demonstrated detectable oral absorption. Thus, it can be concluded that D26 is a promising candidate for further development as a long-acting, orally applicable HIV-1 inactivator for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."
38887114,Impact of trenbolone on selected organs.,"Trenbolone is a synthetic analogue of testosterone, belonging to the nandrolone group. It has both a strong anabolic effect and a limited androgenic effect (i.e. an androgen and anabolic steroid - AAS). It is used illegally by professional or amateur athletes, who want to improve their athletic performance and appearance by increasing their muscle mass. Trenbolone, like other AASs, are harmful, with 90% of users experiencing injurious side effects. It acts systemically on the body, and as such, its side effects can manifest as symptoms from different systems. Nevertheless, its popularity is increasing. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the adverse effects of trenbolone on the nervous, reproductive, immune systems and breast, muscular and adipose tissues. However, various other adverse consequences of trenbolone utilization are observed, with severe acne and gynaecomastia affecting approximately one-third of all users, as well as excessive body hair, stretch marks, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia. The drugs are also subject to contamination, with use frequently resulting in local inflammation at the injection site, muscle adhesions and fibrosis, nerve damage or, in extreme cases, necrosis of the injection site. Additionally, due to the lack of available knowledge on the subject, many of the effects of trenbolone use remain unknown. Moreover, the fact that multiple AASs may be used simultaneously presents a significant problem in their study. Therefore, further research is necessary to better understand the effects of AAS on the body, and to expand our currently incomplete knowledge of their functional pathways."
38887226,Asylum seekers and the role of the acute care physician.,"There has been a recent influx of migrants and asylum seekers to the United States. They often arrive with poor social support and an inability to access reliable health care. This can lead to overutilization of emergency departments (ED) while awaiting legal proceedings. With asylum seekers in all 50 states, it is important for emergency physicians (EP) to understand the barriers to care and difficulties asylum seekers face, and to gain tools to improve both migrants' and community health. Migration and experiences within the United States can worsen pre-existing health conditions. EPs are uniquely positioned to screen for acute pathology and link people to care. Psychiatric illnesses may present differently in asylum seekers. EPs must understand the sequalae of trauma to address it. EPs must also be aware of legal protections for asylum seekers to care for these patients, and recognize challenges faced by the population to mitigate health disparities."
38885958,Three Things We Learned Along the Way: lessons for training in psychiatric epidemiology.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, and its associated mortality, morbidity, deep social and economic impacts was a global traumatic stressor that challenged population mental health and our de-facto mental health care system in unprecedented ways. Yet in many respects, this 'crisis' is not new. Psychiatric epidemiologists have recognized for decades the need and unmet need of people in distress and the limits of the public mental health services in the United States. We argue that psychiatric epidemiologists have a critical role to play as we endeavor to address population mental health and draw attention to three areas of consideration: the need to elevate population based solutions; engaging equitably with lived experience; and interrogating recovery. Psychiatric epidemiology has a long history of both responding to and shaping our understandings of the relationships among psychiatric disorders and society through evolving methods and training, and the current socio-historical moment again suggests that shifts in our practice can strengthen our field and its impact."
38888033,Diasporas as a linchpin in local and international humanitarian action: a case study of the Chinese in Aceh following the 2004 tsunami.,"Chinese humanitarian actors have worked frequently with the Chinese diaspora in disaster-affected areas, but little, if any, research has been conducted into the important role of the diaspora in disaster response and humanitarian assistance. This paper investigates what local knowledge the Chinese diaspora has offered to humanitarian actors from the People's Republic of China (PRC), and how this has contributed to their effectiveness. Based on a case study of the semi-autonomous Indonesian province of Aceh in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, this paper argues that the diaspora can serve as a linchpin in local and international humanitarian action. It can do so by strengthening networks and bringing together local ethnic communities, local governments, and the PRC's humanitarian actors, while also offering local knowledge in the form of contextual memory. Such local knowledge may have to be fully utilised to address any underlying ethnic tensions in disaster-affected areas."
38886035,Designing and synthesizing peptide-based quorum sensing modulators.,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a density-dependent bacterial communication system that uses small molecules as regulatory modulators. Synthetic changes to these molecules can up-or-down-regulate this system, leading to control of phenotypes, like competence and virulence factor production, that have implications in human health. In this chapter, a methodology for library design and screening of synthetic autoinducing peptides (AIPs) to uncover QS SARs is delineated. Additionally, procedures for the synthesis, purification and analysis of linear and cyclic AIPs are detailed. This includes solutions for potential synthetic challenges including diketopiperazine formation when using N-methyl amino acids and cyclization of peptides containing N-terminal cysteine residues. These procedures have and are currently being applied to develop potent QS modulators in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus gordonii and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum."
38886191,Analysis of CCND3 mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), accounts for 30-40% of newly diagnosed lymphomas, has an overall cure rate of approximately 60%. Despite previous reports suggesting a negative prognostic association between CCND3 mutations and Burkitt lymphoma, their prognostic implications in DLBCL remain controversial. To investigate this, we evaluated CCND3 mutation status in 2059 DLBCL patient samples from four database (integrated cohort) and additional 167 DLBCL patient samples in our center (JSPH cohort). The mutation was identified in 5.5% (113/2059) of the cases in the integrated cohort, with 86% (97/113) found in exon 5. Furthermore, P284, R271, I290 and Q276 are described as CCND3 mutation hotspots. CCND3 mutation was associated with decreased overall survival (OS) in the integrated cohort (P = 0.0407). Further subgroup analysis revealed that patients diagnosed as EZB subtype DLBCL by LymphGen algorithm with CCND3 mutations had poorer OS than patients diagnosed as EZB subtype without CCND3 mutations (P = 0.0140). Using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the JSPH cohort, it was found that both cell cycle and DNA replication pathways were highly upregulated in patients with CCND3 mutations. Our results suggest that CCND3 mutations can serve as a novel prognostic factor in DLBCL pathogenesis. Consequently, the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for DLBCL patients with CCND3 mutations might enhance their prognosis."
38887055,Bridging the gap: The future of biosimilars regulations.,"Biosimilar vaccines and immunotherapeutic are innovative approaches in medical research. This commentary addresses the current disparities in regulations of biosimilar vaccines and immunotherapeutic products across different nations. It also navigates the benefits of global regulatory alignment and challenges that may be encountered. The current discrepancies in regulations across different countries, which pose significant challenges for the development and approval of biosimilar vaccines and immunotherapeutic products. These disparities often lead to delayed market access, increased development costs, and hindered innovation. The commentary stresses that such obstacles could be mitigated through harmonized regulations, resulting in faster approvals, reduced healthcare costs, and improved patient outcomes. Moreover, the commentary explores the specific complexities associated with biosimilar vaccines and immunotherapeutic, such as the intricate evaluation of biosimilarity due to their molecular composition and immunogenic properties. In conclusion, the editorial advocates for collaborative efforts to overcome the challenges in achieving global regulatory harmonization for biosimilars. This includes establishing uniform standards, fostering international cooperation among regulatory agencies, and promoting educational initiatives for healthcare providers and regulators. The ultimate goal is to ensure that patients worldwide have timely access to safe, effective, and affordable biosimilar treatments."
38885805,A miR-361-5p/ ORC6/ PLK1 axis regulates prostate cancer progression.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent malignant tumor of the genitourinary system, and metastatic disease has a significant impact on the prognosis of PCa patients. As a result, knowing the processes of PCa development can help patients achieve better outcomes. Here, we investigated the expression and function of ORC6 in PCa. Our findings indicated that ORC6 was elevated in advanced PCa tissues. Patients with PCa who exhibited high levels of ORC6 had a poor prognosis. Following that, we investigated the function of ORC6 in PCa progression using a variety of functional experiments both in vivo and in vitro, and discovered that ORC6 knockdown inhibited PCa cell proliferation, growth, and migration. Furthermore, RNA-seq was employed to examine the molecular mechanism of PCa progression. The results revealed that ORC6 might promote the expression of PLK1, a serine/threonine kinase in PCa cells. We also discovered that ORC6 as a novel miR-361-5p substrate using database analysis, and miR-361-5p was found to lower ORC6 expression. Additionally, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter tests revealed that the transcription factor E2F1 could regulate ORC6 expression in PCa cells. PLK1 overexpression or miR-361-5p inhibitor treatment effectively removed the inhibitory effects caused by ORC6 silencing. Notably, our data showed that therapeutically targeting the miR-361-5p/ ORC6/ PLK1 axis may be a viable therapy option for PCa."
38886565,Naturally sterile Mus spretus hybrids are suitable for the generation of pseudopregnant embryo transfer recipients.,"For the preparation of embryo transfer recipients, surgically vasectomized mice are commonly used, generated by procedures associated with pain and discomfort. Sterile transgenic strains provide a nonsurgical replacement, but their maintenance requires breeding and genotyping procedures. We have previously reported the use of naturally sterile STUSB6F1 hybrids for the production of embryo transfer recipients and found the behavior of these recipients to be indistinguishable from those generated by vasectomized males. The method provides two substantial 3R impacts: refinement (when compared with surgical vasectomy) and reduction in breeding procedures (compared with sterile transgenic lines). Despite initial promise, the 3Rs impact of this innovation was limited by difficulties in breeding the parental STUS/Fore strain, which precluded the wider distribution of the sterile hybrid. The value of a 3R initiative is only as good as the uptake in the community. Here we, thus, select a different naturally sterile hybrid, generated from strains that are widely available: the B6SPRTF1 hybrid between C57BL/6J and Mus spretus. We first confirmed its sterility by sperm counting and testes weight and then trialed the recovery of cryopreserved embryos and germplasm within three UK facilities. Distribution of sperm for the generation of these hybrids by in vitro fertilization was found to be the most robust distribution method and avoided the need to maintain a live M. spretus colony. We then tested the suitability of B6SPRTF1 sterile hybrids for the generation of embryo transfer recipients at these same three UK facilities and found the hybrids to be suitable when compared with surgical vasectomized mice and a sterile transgenic strain. In conclusion, the potential 3Rs impact of this method was confirmed by the ease of distribution and the utility of sterile B6SPRTF1 hybrids at independent production facilities."
38887142,Structures and protein engineering of the α-keto acid C-methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA for rational substrate transfer.,"S‑adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases (MTs) are involved in the C-methylation of a variety of natural products. The MTs SgvM from Streptomyces griseoviridis and MrsA from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae catalyze the methylation of the β-carbon atom of α-keto acids in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic natural products viridogrisein and 3‑methylarginine, respectively. MrsA shows high substrate selectivity for 5‑guanidino-2-oxovalerate, while other α-keto acids, such as the SgvM substrates 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate, 2-oxovalerate, and phenylpyruvate, are not accepted. Here we report the crystal structures of SgvM and MrsA in the apo form bound with substrate or S‑adenosyl-l-methionine. By investigating key residues for substrate recognition in the active sites of both enzymes and engineering MrsA by site-directed mutagenesis, the substrate range of MrsA was extended to accept α‑keto acid substrates of SgvM with uncharged and lipophilic β‑residues. Our results showcase the transfer of the substrate scope of α-keto acid MTs from different biosynthetic pathways by rational design."
38885858,Natural lignin nanoparticles target tumor by saturating the phagocytic capacity of Kupffer cells in the liver.,"Ligand-receptor recognition serves as the fundamental driving force for active targeting, yet it is still constrained by off-target effects. Herein, we demonstrate that circumventing or blocking the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) are both viable strategies to address off-target effects. Naturally derived lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) show great potential to block MPS due to its good stability, low toxicity, and degradability. We further demonstrate the impact of LNPs dosage on in vivo tumor targeting and antitumor efficacy. Our results show that a high dose of LNPs (300 mg/kg) leads to significant accumulation at the tumor site for a duration of 14 days after intravenous administration. In contrast, the low-dose counterparts (e.g., 50, 150 mg/kg) result in almost all LNPs accumulating in the liver. This discovery indicates that the liver is the primary site of LNP capture, leaving only the surplus LNPs the chance to reach the tumor. In addition, although cell membrane-engineered LNPs can rapidly penetrate tumors, they are still prone to capture by the liver during subsequent circulation in the bloodstream. Excitingly, comparable therapeutic efficacy is obtained for the above two strategies. Our findings may offer valuable insights into the targeted delivery of drugs for disease treatment."
38886876,Spatial metabolomics reveals key features of hippocampal lipid changes in rats with postoperative cognitive dysfunction.,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after cardiac surgery. Numerous evidence suggest that dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with cognitive impairment; however, its precise role in the development of POCD is still obscure. In this study, we established a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) model in rats and employed the Barnes maze to assess cognitive function, selecting POCD rats for subsequent experimentation. Utilizing mass spectrometry imaging, we detected plenty of lipids accumulates within the hippocampal CA1in the POCD group. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant reduction in the fluorescence intensity of calcium-independent phospholipases A2 (iPLA2) in the POCD group compared to the control, while serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT) was markedly increased in the POCD group. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the number of synapses in hippocampal CA1decreased significantly and postsynaptic density became thinner in POCD group. Furthermore, after reversing the metabolic disorders of iPLA2 and SPT in the rat brain with docosahexaenoic acid and myriocin, the incidence of POCD after CPB was significantly reduced and the disrupted lipid metabolism in the hippocampus was also normalized. These findings may offer a novel perspective for exploring the etiology and prevention strategies of POCD after CPB."
38887077,State-dependent dynamics of cuttlefish mantle activity.,"Cuttlefish skin is a powerful rendering device, capable of producing extraordinary changes in visual appearance over a broad range of temporal scales. This unique ability is typically associated with camouflage, however cuttlefish often produce skin patterns that do not appear connected with the surrounding environment, such as fast large-scale fluctuations with wave-like characteristics. Little is known about the functional significance of these dynamic patterns. In this study, we develop novel tools for analyzing pattern dynamics, and we demonstrate their utility for detecting changes in feeding state that occur without concomitant changes in sensory stimulation. Under these conditions, we find that the dynamic properties of specific pattern components differ for different feeding states, despite no measurable change in the overall expression of those components. These dynamic changes are therefore not detectable by conventional analyses focusing on pattern expression, requiring analytical tools specifically targeted to pattern dynamics."
38886498,Desensitizing efficacy of a universal dentin adhesive containing mesoporous bioactive glass on dentin hypersensitivity: a randomized clinical trial with a split-mouth model.,"This split-mouth blinded randomized controlled study compared the efficacy of a desensitizing agent with oxalate/resin polymer and a universal adhesive containing mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) for dentin hypersensitivity (DH) relief, using Schiff sensitivity score (SSS) and visual analog scale (VAS). Split quadrants containing teeth with DH were treated with either MS Coat ONE or Hi-Bond Universal with MBG as the functional additive. Assessments at baseline, immediately post-application, and at 1- and 2-week follow-ups used standardized stimulus protocols (air, cold, and acid). The SSS difference was the primary outcome, while the VAS difference was the secondary outcome. A mixed linear effect model performed statistical analysis. Immediate DH reduction occurred in response to air stimuli, with a significant decrease in Group HB than in Group MS (p = 0.0178). Cold stimulus reduction exhibited a gradual cumulative effect, with consistently greater reductions in Group HB than in Group MS (p ≤ 0.0377). Both groups effectively managed acidic stimuli, with no significant differences (p > 0.05). The VAS scores decreased gradually over the follow-up period (p < 0.0001). This study highlights the differential efficacy of treatments for various DH triggers and recommends specific approaches based on different stimulus types. The universal adhesive containing MBG demonstrated DH relief potential, promising efficacy identical to or superior to that of a dedicated desensitizing agent. Further research exploring the long-term efficacy and underlying mechanisms is warranted. The universal adhesive containing MBG can be adopted as an in-office desensitizing agent for DH relief. The desensitizing efficacy of universal adhesive matches or surpasses dedicated agents for air and cold stimuli."
38887177,Poly(N-Heterocyclic Carbene)-Capped Alloy and Core-Shell AuAg Bimetallic Nanoparticles.,"N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-stabilized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted considerable attention. While most efforts in the field have been devoted to the development of NHC-tethered monometallic NPs and enhancing their stabilities under various conditions, their bimetallic counterparts are rare in the literature. Herein, we demonstrate that the covalent immobilization of Au and Ag atoms on polymerized NHCs is a powerful method to access bimetallic AuAg NPs. In addition, we show that while AuAg alloy NPs are often obtained via this method, the use of bimetallic polymeric substrates with lower Ag content, relative to Au, results in the formation of core-shell NPs with Au core and Ag shell. Application of these nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated with all materials exhibiting electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates for the first time that while bimetallic poly(NHC-metal)s are viable substrates to access NHC-stabilized bimetallic NPs, careful adjustment of metal content in the polymeric substrates can finetune the microstructure of the resulting NPs, i.e. alloy vs. core-shell."
38887481,Antifungals in Patients With Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: Clinical Implications.,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving technique used in critical care medicine for patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure. This review examines the treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections in ECMO patients, proposing specific regimens based on available data for different antifungals (azoles, echinocandins, amphotericin B/liposomal amphotericin B) and invasive fungal infections. Currently, isavuconazole and posaconazole have the most supported data, while modified dosages of isavuconazole are recommended in ECMO. Echinocandins are preferred for invasive candidiasis. However, choosing echinocandins is challenging due to limited and varied data on concentration loss in the ECMO circuit. Caution is likewise advised when using liposomal amphotericin B due to uncertain concentrations and potential ECMO dysfunction based on scarce data. We further conclude with the importance of further research on the impact of ECMO on antifungal drug concentrations to optimize dosing regimens in critically ill patients."
38885865,Effects of steaming on physicochemical and emulsification properties of gum arabic.,"Gum arabic finds extensive application and typically undergoes sterilization prior to utilization in the food industry. This study explored the impact of steam sterilization temperature and duration on the physicochemical and emulsification characteristics of gum arabic, accompanied by proposed mechanisms elucidating observed effects. The results showed that when gum arabic was treated with high temperature sterilization (110 °C ~ 140 °C), the emulsion prepared turned unstable. The interfacial tension decreased from 8.26 mN/m to 6.77 mN/m after sterilization, while the elastic modulus decreased from 23.65 mN/m to 16.16 mN/m. Moreover, the circular dichroic chromatographic results indicated that the arabinogalactan protein (AGP) structure of gum arabic was more relaxed after high temperature treatment with β-sheets content decreased from 36.2 % to 29.8 % and random coil content increased from 41.3 % to 51.8 %. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) results demonstrated that emulsion surface film thickness and toughness decreased after sterilization treatment of gum arabic. The study indicates that high temperature sterilization may change protein structure in gum arabic and reduce the stability of prepared emulsions."
38887976,Rational Molecular Design of Diketopyrrolopyrrole-Based n-Type and Ambipolar Polymer Semiconductors.,"Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymer semiconductors have drawn great attention in the field of organic electronics due to the planar structure, decent solubilizing capability, and high crystallinity. However, the electron-deficient capacity of DPP derivatives are not strong enough, leading to relatively high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the corresponding polymers. As a result, n-type and ambipolar DPP-based polymers are rare and their electron mobilities also lag far behind the p-type counterparts, which limits the development of important p-n-junction-based electronic devices. Therefore, new design strategies have been proposed recent years to develop n-type/ambipolar DPP-based polymers with improved performances. In this view, these molecular design strategies are summarized, including copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP-core ring expansion and DPP dimerization. The relationship between the chemical structures and organic thin-film transistor performances is intensively discussed. Finally, a perspective on future trends in the molecular design of DPP-based n-type/ambipolar polymers is also proposed."
38887330,Early Surveillance Endoscopy Should Be Performed Selectively After Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery for Rectal Lesions.,"Introduction Local recurrence (LR) rates after transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) are unclear, and the utility of early postoperative surveillance for low-risk lesions is unknown. This study aimed to define LR after TEM for benign polyps and invasive adenocarcinoma, describe risk factors for LR, and evaluate the utility of early surveillance endoscopy. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at two hospitals in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Adult patients who underwent TEM between 2009 and 2020 were evaluated for inclusion. The primary outcome was the rate of LR on surveillance endoscopy. Other outcomes included risk factors for LR and diagnostic yield of surveillance endoscopy. Results Among 357 patients who underwent TEM for benign polyps, LR was 10.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.8-15.2) at three years. Positive margin was correlated with LR on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 8.01, 95% CI 2.78-23.08). TEM defect closure was associated with lower LR on multivariate analysis (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.59). Among 124 patients who underwent TEM for rectal adenocarcinoma, LR was 15.0% (95% CI 6.0-24.0) at three years. The first surveillance endoscopy had a 1.4% yield for low-risk patients (benign lesion, negative margins, and closed TEM defect) and 6.9% for all others. Conclusions LR at three years after TEM was 10.5% for benign polyps and 15.0% for adenocarcinomas. Early surveillance endoscopy can be considered low yield in some patients after TEM, which can be informative for shared decision-making regarding whether to proceed with early endoscopy in a low-risk subgroup of patients."
38885787,A responsible framework for applying artificial intelligence on medical images and signals at the point-of-care: the PACS-AI platform.,"The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine lies in its ability to enhance clinicians' capacity to analyze medical images, thereby improving diagnostic precision and accuracy, thus enhancing current tests. However, the integration of AI within healthcare is fraught with difficulties. Heterogeneity among healthcare system applications, reliance on proprietary closed-source software, and rising cyber-security threats pose significant challenges. Moreover, prior to their deployment in clinical settings, AI models must demonstrate their effectiveness across a wide range of scenarios and must be validated by prospective studies, but doing so requires testing in an environment mirroring the clinical workflow which is difficult to achieve without dedicated software. Finally, the use of AI techniques in healthcare raises significant legal and ethical issues, such as the protection of patient privacy, the prevention of bias, and the monitoring of the device's safety and effectiveness for regulatory compliance. This review describes challenges to AI integration in healthcare and provides guidelines on how to move forward. We describe an open-source solution that we developed which integrates AI models into the Picture Archives Communication System (PACS), called PACS-AI. This approach aims to increase the evaluation of AI models by facilitating their integration and validation with existing medical imaging databases. PACS-AI may overcome many current barriers to AI deployment and offers a pathway towards responsible, fair, and effective deployment of AI models in healthcare. Additionally, we propose a list of criteria and guidelines that AI researchers should adopt when publishing a medical AI model, to enhance standardization and reproducibility."
38886935,Context-dependent role of sirtuin 2 in inflammation.,"Sirtuin 2 is a member of the sirtuin family nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases, known for its regulatory role in different processes, including inflammation. In this context, sirtuin 2 has been involved in the modulation of key inflammatory signaling pathways and transcription factors by deacetylating specific targets, such as nuclear factor κB and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-leucine-rich-repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3). However, whether sirtuin 2-mediated pathways induce a pro- or an anti-inflammatory response remains controversial. Sirtuin 2 has been implicated in promoting inflammation in conditions such as asthma and neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that its inhibition in these conditions could be a potential therapeutic strategy. Conversely, arthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus studies suggest that sirtuin 2 is essential at the peripheral level and, thus, its inhibition in these pathologies would not be recommended. Overall, the precise role of sirtuin 2 in inflammation appears to be context-dependent, and further investigation is needed to determine the specific molecular mechanisms and downstream targets through which sirtuin 2 influences inflammatory processes in various tissues and pathological conditions. The present review explores the involvement of sirtuin 2 in the inflammation associated with different pathologies to elucidate whether its pharmacological modulation could serve as an effective strategy for treating this prevalent symptom across various diseases."
38886006,LogicGep: Boolean networks inference using symbolic regression from time-series transcriptomic profiling data.,"Reconstructing the topology of gene regulatory network from gene expression data has been extensively studied. With the abundance functional transcriptomic data available, it is now feasible to systematically decipher regulatory interaction dynamics in a logic form such as a Boolean network (BN) framework, which qualitatively indicates how multiple regulators aggregated to affect a common target gene. However, inferring both the network topology and gene interaction dynamics simultaneously is still a challenging problem since gene expression data are typically noisy and data discretization is prone to information loss. We propose a new method for BN inference from time-series transcriptional profiles, called LogicGep. LogicGep formulates the identification of Boolean functions as a symbolic regression problem that learns the Boolean function expression and solve it efficiently through multi-objective optimization using an improved gene expression programming algorithm. To avoid overly emphasizing dynamic characteristics at the expense of topology structure ones, as traditional methods often do, a set of promising Boolean formulas for each target gene is evolved firstly, and a feed-forward neural network trained with continuous expression data is subsequently employed to pick out the final solution. We validated the efficacy of LogicGep using multiple datasets including both synthetic and real-world experimental data. The results elucidate that LogicGep adeptly infers accurate BN models, outperforming other representative BN inference algorithms in both network topology reconstruction and the identification of Boolean functions. Moreover, the execution of LogicGep is hundreds of times faster than other methods, especially in the case of large network inference."
38886544,The influence of Chinese typography on information dissemination in graphic design: based on eye-tracking data.,"The arrangement of Chinese characters has a significant impact on the visual effect and information dissemination in graphic design. In traditional Chinese layout, vertical arrangement of characters is predominant, but in recent times, there has been a gradual transition towards horizontal arrangement. To compare the influence of different character arrangement forms on visual meaning generation and information dissemination, This study employed an eye-tracking experiment to investigate two common Chinese character layouts in posters-horizontal and vertical, and collected data such as eye-tracking heatmap, pupil diameter and eye-tracking trajectory map. Based on objective eye-tracking data, combined with post-test interviews and questionnaire surveys, it was found that vertical character arrangement in Chinese typography is more effective in attracting visual attention and facilitating the expression and stimulating interest in viewing/reading under the premise of meeting formal requirements, which may provide guidance and inspiration for the practical application of Chinese characters in layout design, advertising design, packaging design, exhibition design, UI design, and other related fields."
38887326,Risk of Misdiagnosis in Spinal Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis: A Report of Two Cases.,"Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. It typically manifests in the cranium; cases involving the spinal cord are rare (8.6%). This report includes two cases of spinal HP encountered among 666 spinal operative cases. The purpose of this study is to present the initial imaging findings, final diagnosis, and course of treatment in these two cases of spinal HP and to present the possible risk of misdiagnosis with a literature review. In case 1, a 69-year-old female presented with back pain. The initial radiological diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was a meningioma. However, her blood test showed a mild elevation of C-reactive protein level (3.16 mg/dL), with positive IgG4 and myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody results, suggesting an autoimmune disease. We performed a biopsy of the thickened dura and an expansive duraplasty. Serological and pathological diagnosis suggested IgG4-related HP. In case 2, a 67-year-old male presented with bilateral thigh pain. MRI revealed a mass resembling a disc hernia at the L2/3 intervertebral level. The mass was surgically removed. Pathological examination and cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis of HP associated with IgG4-related disease. In both cases, immunosuppressive therapy was administered, and follow-up MRI scans revealed the disappearance of the mass. The study concludes that a spinal HP can potentially be misdiagnosed when its images resemble those of tumors or disc hernias owing to its rarity."
38887557,Reflections on the regulatory field covering the development of paediatric medicinal products: a brief overview of current status and challenges.,"Many medicinal products are initially developed and tested in adults, and often, only a limited amount of data on their safety and efficacy in children exist. Consequently, paediatric healthcare providers sometimes need to make informed decisions about using medicinal products in children based on available fragmentary data. Ethical guidelines emphasise the importance of protecting children and ensuring they receive safe and effective medical treatments. Paediatric clinical trials should be conducted to provide evidence-based care with specific attention to minimise risks to children. This highlights the dilemma of finding a balance between protecting children and adolescents (and avoiding unnecessary clinical trials) and obtaining reliable, robust and justified data to treat them adequately and not in an off-label manner with unknown risks. For years, paediatricians maintained that children and adolescents are not treated based on up-to-date scientific knowledge and justification. The slogan ""children are not small adults"" summarised the concerns in a catch phrase. Different stakeholders have taken a variety of actions to address this concern."
38885855,"Transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase genes in Aurantiochytrium limacinum strain BL10: Responses to nitrogen starvation.","Under nitrogen deficient conditions, the Aurantiochytrium limacinum strain BL10 greatly increases the production of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and n-6 docosapentaenoic acid. Researchers have yet to elucidate the mechanism by which BL10 promotes the activity of polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase (Pfa), which plays a key role in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Analysis in the current study revealed that in nitrogen-depleted environments, BL10 boosts the transcription and synthesis of proteins by facilitating the expression of pfa genes via transcriptional regulation. It was also determined that BL10 adjusts the lengths of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (suggesting post-transcriptional regulation) and modifies the ratio of two Pfa1 isoforms to favor PUFA production via post-translational regulation (ubiquitination). These findings clarify the exceptional DHA production of BL10 and provide additional insights into the regulatory mechanisms of PUFA biosynthesis in Aurantiochytrium."
38886475,Adiposity in mares induces insulin dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction which can be mitigated by nutritional intervention.,"Obesity is a complex disease associated with augmented risk of metabolic disorder development and cellular dysfunction in various species. The goal of the present study was to investigate the impacts of obesity on the metabolic health of old mares as well as test the ability of diet supplementation with either a complex blend of nutrients designed to improve equine metabolism and gastrointestinal health or L-carnitine alone to mitigate negative effects of obesity. Mares (n = 19, 17.9 ± 3.7 years) were placed into one of three group: normal-weight (NW, n = 6), obese (OB, n = 7) or obese fed a complex diet supplement for 12 weeks (OBD, n = 6). After 12 weeks and completion of sample collections, OB mares received L-carnitine alone for an additional 6 weeks. Obesity in mares was significantly associated with insulin dysregulation, reduced muscle mitochondrial function, and decreased skeletal muscle oxidative capacity with greater ROS production when compared to NW. Obese mares fed the complex diet supplement had better insulin sensivity, greater cell lipid metabolism, and higher muscle oxidative capacity with reduced ROS production than OB. L-carnitine supplementation alone did not significantly alter insulin signaling, but improved lipid metabolism and muscle oxidative capacity with reduced ROS. In conclusion, obesity is associated with insulin dysregulation and altered skeletal muscle metabolism in older mares. However, dietary interventions are an effective strategy to improve metabolic status and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in older mares."
38886854,Alpha-synuclein-induced stress sensitivity renders the Parkinson's disease brain susceptible to neurodegeneration.,"A link between chronic stress and Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis is emerging. Ample evidence demonstrates that the presynaptic neuronal protein alpha-synuclein (asyn) is closely tied to PD pathogenesis. However, it is not known whether stress system dysfunction is present in PD, if asyn is involved, and if, together, they contribute to neurodegeneration. To address these questions, we assess stress axis function in transgenic rats overexpressing full-length wildtype human asyn (asyn BAC rats) and perform multi-level stress and PD phenotyping following chronic corticosterone administration. Stress signaling, namely corticotropin-releasing factor, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor gene expression, is also examined in post-mortem PD patient brains. Overexpression of human wildtype asyn leads to HPA axis dysregulation in rats, while chronic corticosterone administration significantly aggravates nigrostriatal degeneration, serine129 phosphorylated asyn (pS129) expression and neuroinflammation, leading to phenoconversion from a prodromal to an overt motor PD phenotype. Interestingly, chronic corticosterone in asyn BAC rats induces a robust, twofold increase in pS129 expression in the hypothalamus, the master regulator of the stress response, while the hippocampus, both a regulator and a target of the stress response, also demonstrates elevated pS129 asyn levels and altered markers of stress signalling. Finally, defective hippocampal stress signalling is mirrored in human PD brains and correlates with asyn expression levels. Taken together, our results link brain stress system dysregulation with asyn and provide evidence that elevated circulating glucocorticoids can contribute to asyn-induced neurodegeneration, ultimately triggering phenoconversion from prodromal to overt PD."
38885872,"Target recycle initiated entropy driven assembly strategy for sensitive, enzyme-free, and portable miRNA detection.","MicroRNA (miRNA) is a pivotal biomarker in the diagnosis of various cancers, including bladder cancer (BCa). Despite their significance, the low abundance of miRNA presents a substantial challenge for sensitive and reliable detection. We introduce an innovative, highly sensitive assay for miRNA expression quantification that is both enzyme-free and portable. This method leverages the synergy of target recycling and entropy-driven assembly (EDA) for enhanced sensitivity and specificity. The proposed method possesses several advantages, including i) dual signal amplification through target recycling and EDA, which significantly boosts sensitivity with a lower limit of detection of 2.54 fM; ii) elimination of enzyme requirements, resulting in a cost-effective and stable signal amplification process; and iii) utilization of a personal glucose meter (PGM) for signal recording, rendering the method portable and adaptable to diverse settings. In summary, this PGM-based approach holds promising potential for clinical molecular diagnostics, offering a practical and efficient solution for miRNA analysis in cancer detection."
38886385,Costs of obesity attributable to the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in Brazil.,"Excess sugar is considered one of the primary factors contributing to overweight status. In Brazil, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) contain a significant amount of this nutrient and are consumed excessively. These beverages are associated with adverse health outcomes and impose costs on the healthcare system. The literature currently lacks studies that aim to attribute specific nutrients or foods as causes of diseases and also evaluate their economic impact, especially in middle- and low-income countries. This study aims to estimate the direct and indirect costs of obesity, stratified by sex and age group, resulting from the excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in Brazil from 2008 to 2020, and to project these costs for the year 2036. The estimation of obesity costs attributable to excessive consumption of SSBs was based on relative risks and the population prevalence of obesity, considering expenditures on hospitalizations and outpatient procedures in the Unified Health System (SUS). Cost information was obtained from the health information systems available at SUS. The highest burden attributable to the consumption of SSBs was observed among younger individuals and progressively decreased with advancing age. The total direct costs in the period between 2008 and 2020 amounted to approximately US$ 6.33 million, 87% of which was related to expenses for females. Additionally, deaths resulting from the consumption of SSBs cost the economy US$ 40 million due to the premature loss of productivity. The total costs of obesity attributable to the consumption of SSBs are substantial, impacting public spending and generating social and productivity losses that burden the economy. It is crucial to develop and implement cost-effective fiscal and regulatory policies aimed at preventing and combating obesity."
38887595,Endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy: current and the future.,"This article presents an overview of endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy (ERAT), an innovative and minimally invasive treatment for appendicitis with an appendix-preserving manner. Since its initial application in 2009, ERAT has gained significant popularity in China, due to its rapid recovery and minimal risk of complications. The ERAT procedures comprise several steps, including appendiceal orifice access and intubation, appendiceal lumen imaging, decompression and irrigation, fecalith removal, and stenting. ERAT has been used in various forms of complicated appendicitis, such as in pregnant women and children, with continuous improvements in both technique and safety. It has the potential to become the preferred diagnostic and treatment method for appendicitis. Until 2023, over 10,000 ERAT procedures have been successfully conducted in China, and the technique has gained more attention worldwide. However, challenges remain, including training, standardization of ERAT practice, research and technology improvement, enhancing public awareness, and fostering international collaboration. In summary, ERAT can be the standard treatment for appendicitis treatment, which represents a paradigm shift in the conventional clinical practice."
38887864,Label-free imaging diagnosis and collagen-optical evaluation of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with multiphoton microscopy.,"The assessment of tumor grade and pathological stage plays a pivotal role in determining the treatment strategy and predicting the prognosis of endometrial cancer. In this study, we employed multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to establish distinctive optical pathological signatures specific to endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC), while also assessing the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MPM for this particular malignancy. The MPM technique exhibits robust capability in discriminating between benign hyperplasia and various grades of cancer tissue, with statistically significant differences observed in nucleocytoplasmic ratio and second harmonic generation/two-photon excited fluorescence intensity. Moreover, by utilizing semi-automated image analysis, we identified notable disparities in six collagen signatures between benign and malignant endometrial stroma. Our study demonstrates that MPM can differentiate between benign endometrial hyperplasia and EAC without labels, while also quantitatively assessing changes in the tumor microenvironment by analyzing collagen signatures in the endometrial stromal tissue."
38887479,Challenges Facing Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs in the Endemic Region for Coccidioidomycosis.,"Coccidioidomycosis poses a significant cost and morbidity burden in the United States. Additionally, coccidioidomycosis requires constant decision-making related to prevention, diagnosis, and management. Delays in diagnosis lead to significant consequences, including unnecessary diagnostic workup and antibacterial therapy. Antifungal stewardship considerations regarding empiric, prophylactic, and targeted management of coccidioidomycosis are also complex. In this review, the problems facing antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in the endemic region for coccidioidomycosis, consequences due to delayed or missed diagnoses of coccidioidomycosis on antibacterial prescribing, and excess antifungal prescribing for prevention and treatment of coccidioidomycosis are elucidated. Finally, our recommendations and research priorities for ASPs in the endemic region for coccidioidomycosis are outlined."
38886340,Rft1 catalyzes lipid-linked oligosaccharide translocation across the ER membrane.,"The eukaryotic asparagine (N)-linked glycan is pre-assembled as a fourteen-sugar oligosaccharide on a lipid carrier in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Seven sugars are first added to dolichol pyrophosphate (PP-Dol) on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, generating Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (M5GN2-PP-Dol). M5GN2-PP-Dol is then flipped across the bilayer into the lumen by an ER translocator. Genetic studies identified Rft1 as the M5GN2-PP-Dol flippase in vivo but are at odds with biochemical data suggesting Rft1 is dispensable for flipping in vitro. Thus, the question of whether Rft1 plays a direct or an indirect role during M5GN2-PP-Dol translocation has been controversial for over two decades. We describe a completely reconstituted in vitro assay for M5GN2-PP-Dol translocation and demonstrate that purified Rft1 catalyzes the translocation of M5GN2-PP-Dol across the lipid bilayer. These data, combined with in vitro results demonstrating substrate selectivity and rft1∆ phenotypes, confirm the molecular identity of Rft1 as the M5GN2-PP-Dol ER flippase."
38887313,A systematic review of cognitive and behavioral tools to differentiate behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia from other conditions.,"The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is thought to be the commonest clinical presentation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and is predominantly characterized by changes in behavior. In patients lacking unequivocal biomarker evidence of frontotemporal neurodegeneration, the clinical diagnosis of bvFTD is often unstable. In response, we conducted a systematic review and critical appraisal of cognitive and behavioral tools that have sought to differentiate bvFTD from other conditions. A systematic literature review of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted on December 31, 2023 for cognitive and behavioral tools that differentiated bvFTD from other cohorts. Ninety-six studies were included. The quality appraisal of almost all studies was low and introduced a high risk of bias. The few studies that were of high quality had a prospective study design and recruited patients suspected (but not yet confirmed) to have bvFTD. These studies reported that behavioral tools (e.g., the Frontal Behavioral Inventory) and social cognition tests (e.g., the Ekman's Faces Test) had good test performance in differentiating bvFTD from a broad range of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Importantly, the review highlighted the extreme paucity of studies that have evaluated methods where, in Bayesian terms, there is genuine clinical uncertainty regarding a diagnosis of bvFTD. Most studies used healthy controls of typical Alzheimer's disease as comparators-groups that often have negligible pretest probability of bvFTD. In response, we propose a study design checklist for studies seeking to develop diagnostic algorithms in bvFTD research."
38887351,Implementation of an Accelerated Infusion Protocol (90-Minute Infusion) of Rituximab and Its Safety in Patients With Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases at a Tertiary Veterans Affairs Center.,"Background Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 protein on the surface of B cells, is used to treat several rheumatologic and oncologic diseases. The standard infusion duration of rituximab is four hours. Objective Evaluating the safety of administering the accelerated 90-minute protocol at our Veterans Affairs center to patients with rheumatologic diseases and monitoring for any infusion-related reactions. This study is unique as it examines infusion rates faster than those most described (120 minutes). Methods Patients treated with rituximab for autoimmune diseases between June 2020 and June 2022 at our center were included in the study. Our patients were over 18 years of age, met the inclusion criteria, and had received previous rituximab infusions without prior infusion-related reactions. They received the accelerated protocol of 90 minutes over their next cycles and were monitored for any reactions during their infusions. Results A total of 34 patients receiving 76 infusions were included in the analysis. Most of the patients were males (n = 27). The most prevalent indication for rituximab infusion was rheumatoid arthritis (n = 20). Out of 76 infusions, only two infusion-related reactions were recorded (2.6% incidence). The first patient had itching and a sore throat, indicating a grade 1A reaction. The second patient developed chest pain and dyspnea, which resolved with diphenhydramine and albuterol. For both, the infusion was completed after appropriate management. Conclusion The incidence of infusion-related reactions during the accelerated 90-minute rituximab infusion was remarkably low and well-tolerated by our rituximab-experienced patients. Only two infusions were complicated by a reaction, an incidence comparable to or even lower than other reported 120-minute infusion protocols. This protocol is time- and cost-efficient, allowing for more infusions per chair per day at our center."
38886116,Hypothesis: AdAPT-001 and pseudoprogression - when seeing is not necessarily believing.,"The purpose of this commentary is to highlight the high occurrence of clinical pseudoprogression and delayed responses that have been observed to date with the locally injected oncolytic adenovirus, AdAPT-001, currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT04673942) for the treatment of treatment-refractory tumors. Not surprisingly, these have led to confusion about response assessment and whether to continue patients on treatment. AdAPT-001 carries a transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta trap (TGF-β), which sequesters TGF-β, a cytokine that potently regulates inflammation, fibrosis, and immunosuppression in cancer. Pseudoprogression (PsP) or progression prior to response or stabilization, has been widely recognized with radiotherapy for primary brain tumors and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). PsP has also been described and documented in the context of oncolytic virotherapy but perhaps to a lesser extent. However, repeated intratumoral injections with these immunostimulatory agents may induce a more intense immune response and release more antigenic epitopes than with ICIs, for example, which are strictly T-cell directed rather than also tumor-directed like AdAPT-001."
38887853,Advances of the MAPK pathway in the treatment of spinal cord injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a complex pathology within the central nervous system (CNS), leading to severe sensory and motor impairments. It activates various signaling pathways, notably the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Present treatment approaches primarily focus on symptomatic relief, lacking efficacy in addressing the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Emerging research underscores the significance of the MAPK pathway in neuronal differentiation, growth, survival, axonal regeneration, and inflammatory responses post-SCI. Modulating this pathway post-injury has shown promise in attenuating inflammation, minimizing apoptosis, alleviating neuropathic pain, and fostering neural regeneration. Given its pivotal role, the MAPK pathway emerges as a potential therapeutic target in SCI management. This review synthesizes current knowledge on SCI pathology, delineates the MAPK pathway's characteristics, and explores its dual roles in SCI pathology and therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, it addresses the existing challenges in MAPK research in the context of SCI, proposing solutions to overcome these hurdles. Our aim is to offer a comprehensive reference for future research on the MAPK pathway and SCI, laying the groundwork for targeted therapeutic strategies."
38887889,HLA-DPB1 and DPA1 ~ DPB1 linkage mismatch affects the survival of recipients receiving HLA-14/14 matched unrelated donor HSCT.,"To analyse the effect of HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 allelic mismatches on the outcomes of unrelated donor haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (URD-HSCT), we collected 258 recipients with haematological disease who underwent HLA-10/10 matched URD-HSCT. HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, -DRB3/4/5, -DQA1, -DPA1 and -DPB1 typing was performed for the donors and recipients using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. After excluding 8 cases with DQA1 or DRB3/4/5 mismatches, we included 250 cases with HLA-14/14 matching for further analysis. Our results showed that the proportion of matched DPA1 and DPB1 alleles was only 10.4% (26/250). The remaining 89.6% of donors and recipients demonstrated DPA1 or DPB1 mismatch. In the DPA1 matched and DPB1 mismatched group, accounting for 18.8% (47/250) of the cohort, DPB1*02:01/DPB1*03:01 allelic mismatches were associated with decreased 2-year OS and increased NRM. DPB1*02:02/DPB1*05:01 and DPB1*02:01/DPB1*05:01 mismatches showed no impact on outcomes. Moreover, the specific allelic mismatches observed were consistent with the DPB1 T-cell epitope (TCE) classification as permissive and non-permissive. We innovatively established an analysis method for DPA1 ~ DPB1 linkage mismatch for cases with both DPA1 and DPB1 mismatched, accounting for 70% (175/250) of the total. DPA1*02:02 ~ DPB1*05:01/DPA1*02:01 ~ DPB1*17:01 linkage mismatches were associated with lower 2-year OS, especially among AML/MDS recipients. DPA1*02:02 ~ DPB1*05:01/DPA1*01:03 ~ DPB1*02:01 linkage mismatches showed no impact on outcomes. In conclusion, applying the DPA1 ~ DPB1 linkage mismatch analysis approach can identify different types of mismatches affecting transplant outcomes and provide valuable insight for selecting optimal donors for AML/MDS and ALL recipients."
38887449,Identifying molecular subgroups of patients with preeclampsia through bioinformatics.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-related disorder associated with serious complications. Its molecular mechanisms remain undefined; hence, we aimed to identify molecular subgroups of patients with PE using bioinformatics to aid treatment strategies. R software was used to analyze gene expression data of 130 patients with PE and 138 healthy individuals from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Patients with PE were divided into two molecular subgroups using the unsupervised clustering learning method. Clinical feature analysis of subgroups using weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that the patients in subgroup I were primarily characterized by early onset of PE, severe symptoms at disease onset, and induced labor as the main delivery method. Patients in subgroup II primarily exhibited late PE onset, relatively mild symptoms, and natural delivery as the main delivery method. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the significant enrichment of calcium ion channels in subgroup II indicated the potential efficacy of calcium antagonists and magnesium sulfate therapy. In conclusion, the establishment of PE molecular subgroups can aid in diagnosing and treating PE."
38887627,Forgetting ourselves in flow: an active inference account of flow states and how we experience ourselves within them.,"Flow has been described as a state of optimal performance, experienced universally across a broad range of domains: from art to athletics, gaming to writing. However, its phenomenal characteristics can, at first glance, be puzzling. Firstly, individuals in flow supposedly report a loss of self-awareness, even though they perform in a manner which seems to evince their agency and skill. Secondly, flow states are felt to be effortless, despite the prerequisite complexity of the tasks that engender them. In this paper, we unpick these features of flow, as well as others, through the active inference framework, which posits that action and perception are forms of active Bayesian inference directed at sustained self-organisation; i.e., the minimisation of variational free energy. We propose that the phenomenology of flow is rooted in the deployment of high precision weight over (i) the expected sensory consequences of action and (ii) beliefs about how action will sequentially unfold. This computational mechanism thus draws the embodied cognitive system to minimise the ensuing (i.e., expected) free energy through the exploitation of the pragmatic affordances at hand. Furthermore, given the challenging dynamics the flow-inducing situation presents, attention must be wholly focussed on the unfolding task whilst counterfactual planning is restricted, leading to the attested loss of the sense of self-as-object. This involves the inhibition of both the sense of self as a temporally extended object and higher-order, meta-cognitive forms of self-conceptualisation. Nevertheless, we stress that self-awareness is not entirely lost in flow. Rather, it is pre-reflective and bodily. Our approach to bodily-action-centred phenomenology can be applied to similar facets of seemingly agentive experience beyond canonical flow states, providing insights into the mechanisms of so-called selfless experiences, embodied expertise and wellbeing."
38887923,A novel protocol for three-dimensional mapping of sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus) enclosure use in aquaria: Implications for management.,"This study investigated sand tiger shark (STS; Carcharias taurus) spatial use and exclusion in public aquarium enclosures using a novel protocol for three-dimensional mapping. Fifty-one STS were observed in 14 enclosures, and swimming pattern, depth, and location were recorded in ZooMonitor. Data were converted into quantitative, three-dimensional representations using ArcGIS® Pro v. 2.9. All observed STS except one swam in circular patterns, and 80% (n = 41) showed a directional swimming bias. Most STS (80%; n = 41) predominantly utilized the top two-thirds of the enclosures, though 83% (n = 34) of those had swimming obstructions in the bottom of the enclosure. Avoidance of obstructed areas, sections <7 m wide, as well as behavioral spatial separation, resulted in utilization of between 27% and 66% of available enclosure space. STS underutilized corners, pinch-points, and obstructed areas requiring abrupt directional changes and instead exhibited continual, unimpeded swimming patterns. In addition, this study found no relationship between directional swimming bias or use of smaller enclosure volumes and spinal deformity, a health issue affecting 26% of STS 10 years ago but now with an incidence of 6%. Using novel protocols for three-dimensional mapping and volume estimation, this study demonstrated that enclosures facilitating unimpeded, continuous swimming are most usable for STS and provides important information that will be useful for future enclosure design."
38886186,HCCDB v2.0: Decompose Expression Variations by Single-cell RNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics in HCC.,"Large-scale transcriptomic data are crucial for understanding the molecular features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Integrated 15 transcriptomic datasets of HCC clinical samples, the first version of HCC database (HCCDB v1.0) was released in 2018. Through the meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes and prognosis-related genes across multiple datasets, it provides a systematic view of the altered biological processes and the inter-patient heterogeneities of HCC with high reproducibility and robustness. With four years having passed, the database now needs integration of recently published datasets. Furthermore, the latest single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have provided a great opportunity to decipher complex gene expression variations at the cellular level with spatial architecture. Here, we present HCCDB v2.0, an updated version that combines bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic data of HCC clinical samples. It dramatically expands the bulk sample size by adding 1656 new samples from 11 datasets to the existing 3917 samples, thereby enhancing the reliability of transcriptomic meta-analysis. A total of 182,832 cells and 69,352 spatial spots are added to the single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sections, respectively. A novel single-cell level and 2-dimension (sc-2D) metric is proposed as well to summarize cell type-specific and dysregulated gene expression patterns. Results are all graphically visualized in our online portal, allowing users to easily retrieve data through a user-friendly interface and navigate between different views. With extensive clinical phenotypes and transcriptomic data in the database, we show two applications for identifying prognosis-associated cells and tumor microenvironment. HCCDB v2.0 is available at http://lifeome.net/database/hccdb2."
38885847,EEG emotion recognition based on data-driven signal auto-segmentation and feature fusion.,"Pattern recognition based on network connections has recently been applied to the brain-computer interface (BCI) research, offering new ideas for emotion recognition using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. However unified standards are currently lacking for selecting emotional signals in emotion recognition research, and potential associations between activation differences in brain regions and network connectivity pattern are often being overlooked. To bridge this technical gap, a data-driven signal auto-segmentation and feature fusion algorithm (DASF) is proposed in this paper. First, the Phase Locking Value (PLV) method was used to construct the brain functional adjacency matrix of each subject, and the dynamic brain functional network across subjects was then constructed. Next, tucker decomposition was performed and the Grassmann distance of the connectivity submatrix was calculated. Subsequently, different brain network states were distinguished and signal segments under emotional states were automatically extract using data-driven methods. Then, tensor sparse representation was adopted on the intercepted EEG signals to effectively extract functional connections under different emotional states. Finally, power-distribution related features (differential entropy and energy feature) and brain functional connection features were effectively combined for classification using the support vector machines (SVM) classifier. The proposed method was validated on ERN and DEAP datasets. The single-feature emotion classification accuracy of 86.57 % and 87.74 % were achieved on valence and arousal dimensions, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed feature fusion method was achieved at 89.14 % and 89.65 %, accordingly, demonstrating an improvement in emotion recognition accuracy. The results demonstrated the superior classification performance of the proposed data-driven signal auto-segmentation and feature fusion algorithm in emotion recognition compared to state-of-the-art classification methods."
38885802,Exploitation of Multiple Host-Derived Nutrients by the Yellow Catfish Epidermal Environment Facilitates Vibrio mimicus to Sustain Infection Potency and Susceptibility.,"Infection with Vibrio mimicus in the Siluriformes has demonstrated a rapid and high infectivity and mortality rate, distinct from other hosts. Our earlier investigations identified necrosis, an inflammatory storm, and tissue remodeling as crucial pathological responses in yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) infected with V. mimicus. The objective of this study was to further elucidate the impact linking these pathological responses within the host during V. mimicus infection. Employing metabolomics and transcriptomics, we uncovered infection-induced dense vacuolization of perimysium; Several genes related to nucleosidase and peptidase activities were significantly upregulated in the skin and muscles of infected fish. Concurrently, the translation processes of host cells were impaired. Further investigation revealed that V. mimicus completes its infection process by enhancing its metabolism, including the utilization of oligopeptides and nucleotides. The high susceptibility of yellow catfish to V. mimicus infection was associated with the composition of its body surface, which provided a microenvironment rich in various nucleotides such as dIMP, dAMP, deoxyguanosine, and ADP, in addition to several amino acids and peptides. Some of these metabolites significantly boost V. mimicus growth and motility, thus influencing its biological functions. Furthermore, we uncovered an elevated expression of gangliosides on the surface of yellow catfish, aiding V. mimicus adhesion and increasing its infection risk. Notably, we observed that the skin and muscles of yellow catfish were deficient in over 25 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as Eicosapentaenoic acid, 12-oxo-ETE, and 13-Oxo-ODE. These substances play a role in anti-inflammatory mechanisms, possibly contributing to the immune dysregulation observed in yellow catfish. In summary, our study reveals a host immune deviation phenomenon that promotes bacterial colonization by increasing nutrient supply. It underscores the crucial factors rendering yellow catfish highly susceptible to V. mimicus, indicating that host nutritional sources not only enable the establishment and maintenance of infection within the host but also aid bacterial survival under immune pressure, ultimately completing its lifecycle."
38886621,Peripheral blood mononuclear cell respiratory function is associated with progressive glaucomatous vision loss.,"Intraocular pressure (IOP) is currently the only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma and all licensed treatments lower IOP. However, many patients continue to lose vision despite IOP-lowering treatment. Identifying biomarkers for progressive vision loss would have considerable clinical utility. We demonstrate that lower peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is strongly associated with faster visual field (VF) progression in patients treated by lowering IOP (P < 0.001, 229 eyes of 139 participants), explaining 13% of variance in the rate of progression. In a separate reference cohort of untreated patients with glaucoma (213 eyes of 213 participants), IOP explained 16% of VF progression variance. OCR is lower in patients with glaucoma (n = 168) than in controls (n = 50; P < 0.001) and is lower in patients with low baseline IOP (n = 99) than those with high baseline IOP (n = 69; P < 0.01). PBMC nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels are lower in patients with glaucoma (n = 29) compared to controls (n = 25; P < 0.001) and strongly associated with OCR (P < 0.001). Our results support PBMC OCR and NAD levels as new biomarkers for progressive glaucoma."
38885804,Par3/Bazooka binds NICD and promotes Notch signalling during Drosophila development.,"The conserved bazooka (baz/par3) gene acts as a key regulator of asymmetrical cell divisions across the animal kingdom. Associated Par3/Baz-Par6-aPKC protein complexes are also well known for their role in the establishment of apical/basal cell polarity in epithelial cells. Here we define a novel, positive function of Baz/Par3 in the Notch pathway. Using Drosophila wing and eye development, we demonstrate that Baz is required for Notch signaling activity and optimal transcriptional activation of Notch target genes. Baz appears to act independently of aPKC in these contexts, as knockdown of aPKC does not cause Notch loss-of-function phenotypes. Using transgenic Notch constructs, our data positions Baz activity downstream of activating Notch cleavage steps and upstream of Su(H)/CSL transcription factor complex activity on Notch target genes. We demonstrate a biochemical interaction between NICD and Baz, suggesting that Baz is required for NICD activity before NICD binds to Su(H). Taken together, our data define a novel role of the polarity protein Baz/Par3, as a positive and direct regulator of Notch signaling through its interaction with NICD."
38887854,Soft-Tissue Vibrations and Fatigue During Prolonged Running: Does an Individualized Midsole Hardness Play a Role?,"Footwear has the potential to reduce soft-tissue vibrations (STV) but responses are highly subject-specific. Recent evidence shows that compressive garments minimizing STV have a beneficial effect on neuromuscular (NM) fatigue. The aim was to determine whether an individualized midsole hardness can minimize STV and NM fatigue during a half marathon. Twenty experienced runners were recruited for three visits: a familiarization session including the identification of midsole minimizing and maximizing STV amplitude (MIN and MAX, respectively), and two half marathon sessions at 95% of speed at the second ventilatory threshold. STV of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle, running kinetics, foot strike pattern, rating perceived exhaustion (RPE), and midsole liking were recorded every 3 km. NM fatigue was assessed on plantar flexors (PF) before (PRE) and after (POST) the half marathon. At POST, PF central and peripheral alterations and changes in contact time, step frequency, STV median frequency, and impact force frequency as well as foot strike pattern were found in both MIN and MAX. No significant differences in damping, STV main frequency, flight time, duty factor, and loading rate were observed between conditions whatever the time period. During the half marathon, STV amplitude of GM significantly increased over time for the MAX condition (+13.3%) only. Differences between MIN and MAX were identified for RPE and midsole liking. It could be hypothesized that, while significant, the effect of midsole hardness on STV is too low to substantially affect NM fatigue."
38886167,Fluorinated Protein-Ligand Complexes: A Computational Perspective.,"Fluorine is an element renowned for its unique properties. Its powerful capability to modulate molecular properties makes it an attractive substituent for protein binding ligands; however, the rational design of fluorination can be challenging with effects on interactions and binding energies being difficult to predict. In this Perspective, we highlight how computational methods help us to understand the role of fluorine in protein-ligand binding with a focus on molecular simulation. We underline the importance of an accurate force field, present fluoride channels as a showcase for biomolecular interactions with fluorine, and discuss fluorine specific interactions like the ability to form hydrogen bonds and interactions with aryl groups. We put special emphasis on the disruption of water networks and entropic effects."

38887367,Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities of short-chain fatty acids in posttraumatic stress disorder patients: a mini-review.,"This mini-review explores the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Highlighting the microbiota-gut-brain axis, this study investigated the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and mental health. SCFAs, byproducts of gut microbial fermentation, have been examined for their potential impact on PTSD, with a focus on molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. This review discusses changes in SCFA levels and bacterial profiles in individuals with PTSD, emphasizing the need for further research. Promising outcomes from clinical trials using probiotics and fermented formulations suggest potential avenues for PTSD management. Future directions involve establishing comprehensive human cohorts, integrating multiomics data, and employing advanced computational methods, with the goal of deepening our understanding of the role of SCFAs in PTSD and exploring microbiota-targeted interventions."
38887911,"Leaf morphology related genes revealed by integrating Pan-transcriptome, GWAS and eQTL analyses in a Liriodendron population.","Leaf plays an indispensable role in plant development and growth. Although many known genes related to leaf morphology development have been identified, elucidating the complex genetic basis of leaf morphological traits remains a challenge. Liriodendron plants are common ornamental trees due to their unique leaf shapes, while the molecular mechanism underlying Liriodendron leaf morphogenesis has remained unknown. Herein, we firstly constructed a population-level pan-transcriptome of Liriodendron from 81 accessions to explore the expression presence or absence variations (ePAVs), global expression differences at the population level, as well as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the Liriodendron chinense and Liriodendron tulipifera accessions. Subsequently, we integrated a genome-wide association study (GWAS), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify candidate genes related to leaf morphology. Through GWAS analysis, we identified 18 and 17 significant allelic loci in the leaf size and leaf shape modules, respectively. In addition, we discerned 16 candidate genes in relation to leaf morphological traits via TWAS. Further, integrating the co-localization results of GWAS and eQTL, we determined two regulatory hotspot regions, hot88 and hot758, related to leaf size and leaf shape, respectively. Finally, co-expression analysis, eQTL, and linkage mapping together demonstrated that Lchi_4g10795 regulate their own expression levels through cis-eQTL to affect the expression of downstream genes and cooperatively participate in the development of Liriodendron leaf morphology. These findings will improve our understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanism of Liriodendron leaf morphogenesis and will also accelerate molecular breeding of Liriodendron."
38886533,"Public opinion, racial bias and labour market outcomes in the USA.","Here we study the role of negative shifts in public opinion in the economic lives of under-represented racial groups by investigating sudden changes in views towards Asian people following the anti-Chinese rhetoric that emerged with the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated changes in employment status and earnings in the US labour market. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find that, unlike other under-represented groups, Asian workers in occupations or industries with a higher likelihood of face-to-face interactions before the pandemic were more likely to become unemployed afterwards. While widespread along the political spectrum, negative shifts in the perceived favourability of Asian people, and not of other under-represented groups, were much stronger among those who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and could have been more influenced by the anti-Asian rhetoric."
38887484,Meeting the Therapeutic Challenges of Emergent and Rare Invasive Fungal Diseases Through Novel Clinical Trial Designs.,"Treatments for emerging and rare invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) represent a critical unmet medical need. For IFDs that occur less frequently than invasive aspergillosis, such as mucormycosis, hyalohyphomycosis, and phaeohyphomycosis, randomized controlled clinical trials are impractical and unlikely to meet urgent public health needs. Understanding regulatory approaches for approval of drugs for rare cancers and rare metabolic diseases could help meet the challenges of studying drugs for rare IFDs. A single-arm, controlled clinical trial with a high-quality external control(s), with confirmatory evidence from nonclinical studies, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data in predictive animal models of the disease may support findings of effectiveness of new drugs and biologics. Control populations may include historical controls from published literature, patient registries, and/or contemporaneous external control groups. Continuous engagement among clinicians, industrial sponsors, and regulatory agencies to develop consensus on trial design and innovative development pathways for emergent and rare invasive fungal diseases is important."
38886403,Cascading hazards of a major Bengal basin earthquake and abrupt avulsion of the Ganges River.,"Earthquakes present severe hazards for people and economies and can be primary drivers of landscape change yet their impact to river-channel networks remains poorly known. Here we show evidence for an abrupt earthquake-triggered avulsion of the Ganges River at ~2.5 ka leading to relocation of the mainstem channel belt in the Bengal delta. This is recorded in freshly discovered sedimentary archives of an immense relict channel and a paleo-earthquake of sufficient magnitude to cause major liquefaction and generate large, decimeter-scale sand dikes >180 km from the nearest seismogenic source region. Precise luminescence ages of channel sand, channel fill, and breached and partially liquefied floodplain deposits support coeval timing of the avulsion and earthquake. Evidence for reorganization of the river-channel network in the world's largest delta broadens the risk posed by seismic events in the region and their recognition as geomorphic agents in this and other tectonically active lowlands. The recurrence of comparable earthquake-triggered ground liquefaction and a channel avulsion would be catastrophic for any of the heavily populated, large river basins and deltas along the Himalayan arc (e.g., Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Ayeyarwady). The compounding effects of climate change and human impacts heighten and extend the vulnerability of many lowlands worldwide to such cascading hazards."
38886926,Decoding the language of first impressions: Comparing models of first impressions of faces derived from free-text descriptions and trait ratings.,"First impressions formed from facial appearance predict important social outcomes. Existing models of these impressions indicate they are underpinned by dimensions of Valence and Dominance, and are typically derived by applying data reduction methods to explicit ratings of faces for a range of traits. However, this approach is potentially problematic because the trait ratings may not fully capture the dimensions on which people spontaneously assess faces. Here, we used natural language processing to extract 'topics' directly from participants' free-text descriptions (i.e., their first impressions) of 2222 face images. Two topics emerged, reflecting first impressions related to positive emotional valence and warmth (Topic 1) and negative emotional valence and potential threat (Topic 2). Next, we investigated how these topics were related to Valence and Dominance components derived from explicit trait ratings. Collectively, these components explained only ~44% of the variance in the topics extracted from free-text descriptions and suggested that first impressions are underpinned by correlated valence dimensions that subsume the content of existing trait-rating-based models. Natural language offers a promising new avenue for understanding social cognition, and future work can examine the predictive utility of natural language and traditional data-driven models for impressions in varying social contexts."
38886448,Endothelial dysfunction in retinal vessels of hemodialysis patients compared to healthy controls.,"Endothelial dysfunction is a key factor promoting atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications. Hemodialysis patients typically show various cardiovascular complications and impaired retinal venular dilation has been described as a risk factor for mortality. Non-invasive retinal vessel analysis provides insight into the microvasculature and endothelial function. Static retinal vessel analysis determines arteriolar and venular vessel diameters and dynamic retinal vessel analysis measures microvascular function by flicker-light induced stimulation, which results in physiological dilation of retinal vessels. We measured 220 healthy individuals and compared them to our preexisting cohort of hemodialysis patients (275 for static and 214 for dynamic analysis). Regarding static vessel diameters, hemodialysis patients and healthy individuals did not significantly differ between vessel diameters. Dynamic retinal vessel analysis showed attenuated dilation of the arteriole of hemodialysis patients with 1.6% vs 2.3% in healthy individuals (p = 0.009). Case-control matching for age (mean 65.4 years) did not relevantly diminish the difference. Hemodialysis patients also exhibited reduced venular dilation after matching for age (3.2% vs 3.8%, p = 0.019). Hemodialysis patients showed microvascular dysfunction compared to healthy individuals when using dynamic retinal vessel analysis. Further studies should focus on dynamic retinal vessel analysis which can add insights into the microvascular function and risk factors in multimorbid patients."
38886559,Platelets in Kawasaki disease: mediators of vascular inflammation.,"Kawasaki disease, a systemic vasculitis that affects young children and can result in coronary artery aneurysms, is the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children. A hallmark of Kawasaki disease is increased blood platelet counts and platelet activation, which is associated with an increased risk of developing resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin and coronary artery aneurysms. Platelets and their releasate, including granules, microparticles, microRNAs and transcription factors, can influence innate immunity, enhance inflammation and contribute to vascular remodelling. Growing evidence indicates that platelets also interact with immune and non-immune cells to regulate inflammation. Platelets boost NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production by human immune cells by releasing soluble mediators. Activated platelets form aggregates with leukocytes, such as monocytes and neutrophils, enhancing numerous functions of these cells and promoting thrombosis and inflammation. Leukocyte-platelet aggregates are increased in children with Kawasaki disease during the acute phase of the disease and can be used as biomarkers for disease severity. Here we review the role of platelets in Kawasaki disease and discuss progress in understanding the immune-effector role of platelets in amplifying inflammation related to Kawasaki disease vasculitis and therapeutic strategies targeting platelets or platelet-derived molecules."
38886540,The chloroplast genomes of two medicinal species (Veronica anagallis-aquatica L. and Veronica undulata Wall.) and its comparative analysis with related Veronica species.,"Veronica anagallis-aquatica L. and Veronica undulata Wall. are widely used ethnomedicinal plants in China. The two species have different clinical efficacies, while their extremely similar morphology and unclear interspecific relationship make it difficult to accurately identify them, leading to increased instances of mixed usage. This article reports on the complete chloroplast genomes sequence of these two species and their related Veronica species to conduct a comparative genomics analysis and phylogenetic construction. The results showed that the chloroplast (cp) genomes of Veronica exhibited typical circular quadripartite structures, with total lengths of 149,386 to 152,319 base pairs (bp), and GC content of 37.9 to 38.1%, and the number of genes was between 129-134. The total number of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in V. anagallis-aquatica and V. undulata is 37 and 36, while V. arvensis had the highest total number of 56, predominantly characterized by A/T single bases. The vast majority of long repeat sequence types are forward repeats and palindromic repeats. Selective Ka/Ks values showed that three genes were under positive selection. Sequence differences often occur in the non-coding regions of the large single-copy region (LSC) and small single-copy region (SSC), with the lowest sequence variation in the inverted repeat regions (IR). Seven highly variable regions (trnT-GGU-psbD, rps8-rpl16, trnQ-UUG, trnN-GUU-ndhF, petL, ycf3, and ycf1) were detected, which may be potential molecular markers for identifying V. anagallis-aquatica and V. undulata. The phylogenetic tree indicates that there is a close genetic relationship between the genera Veronica and Neopicrorhiza, and V. anagallis-aquatica and V. undulata are sister groups. The molecular clock analysis results indicate that the divergence time of Veronica may occur at ∼ 9.09 Ma, and the divergence time of these two species occurs at ∼ 0.48 Ma. It is speculated that climate change may be the cause of Veronica species diversity and promote the radiation of the genus. The chloroplast genome data of nine Veronica specie provides important insights into the characteristics and evolution of the chloroplast genome of this genus, as well as the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Veronica."
38885788,Adaptive gene expression of alternative splicing variants of PGC-1α regulates whole-body energy metabolism.,"The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α has been implicated in the regulation of multiple metabolic processes. However, the previously reported metabolic phenotypes of mice deficient in PGC-1α have been inconsistent. PGC-1α exists as multiple isoforms, including variants transcribed from an alternative first exon. We show here that alternative PGC-1α variants are the main entity that increases PGC-1α during exercise. These variants, unlike the canonical isoform of PGC-1α, are robustly upregulated in human skeletal muscle after exercise. Furthermore, the extent of this upregulation correlates with oxygen consumption. Mice lacking these variants manifest impaired energy expenditure during exercise, leading to the development of obesity and hyperinsulinemia. The alternative variants are also upregulated in brown adipose tissue in response to cold exposure, and mice lacking these variants are intolerant of a cold environment. Our findings thus indicate that an increase in PGC-1α expression, attributable mostly to upregulation of alternative variants, is pivotal for adaptive enhancement of energy expenditure and heat production and thereby essential for the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism."
38887448,Tachyarrhythmias in congenital heart disease.,"The prevalence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in adult patients has risen with advances in diagnostic and surgical techniques. Surgical modifications and hemodynamic changes increase the susceptibility to arrhythmias, impacting morbidity and mortality rates, with arrhythmias being the leading cause of hospitalizations and sudden deaths. Patients with CHD commonly experience both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with each CHD type associated with different arrhythmia patterns. Macroreentrant atrial tachycardias, particularly cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent flutter, are frequently reported. Ventricular arrhythmias, including monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, are prevalent, especially in patients with surgical scars. Pharmacological therapy involves antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant drugs, though data are limited with potential adverse effects. Catheter ablation is preferred, demanding meticulous procedural planning due to anatomical complexity and vascular access challenges. Combining imaging techniques with electroanatomic navigation enhances outcomes. However, risk stratification for sudden death remains challenging due to anatomical variability. This article practically reviews the most common tachyarrhythmias, treatment options, and clinical management strategies for these patients."
38887097,IL-2 amplifies quantitative TCR signalling inputs to drive Th1 and Th2 differentiation.,"The activation of CD4+ T-cells in a T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent antigen-specific manner is a central characteristic of the adaptive immune response. In addition to ensuring that CD4+ T-cells recognise their cognate antigen during activation, TCR-mediated signalling can also direct the outcome of differentiation. In both in vivo and in vitro model systems, strong TCR signalling has been demonstrated to drive Th1 differentiation, whereas weak TCR signalling drives Th2 responses. During the process of differentiation, TCR signal strength acts as a quantitative component in combination with the qualitative effects imparted by cytokines to polarise distinct T-helper lineages. Here, we investigated the role of interleukin 2 (IL-2) signalling in determining the outcome of TCR-dependent differentiation. IL-2 production was initiated as an early response to TCR-induced activation and was regulated by the strength of TCR signalling initially received. In the absence of IL-2, TCR dependent differentiation was found to be abolished. However, proliferative responses and early markers of activation were maintained, including the upregulation of GATA3, Tbet and Foxp3 at 24 h post-stimulation. Demonstrating that IL-2 signalling has a key role in stabilising and amplifying lineage-specific transcirption factor expression during differentiation. Further, activation of IL-2-deficient T-cells in the presence of exogenous cytokines was sufficient to restore differentiation whilst maintaining transcriptional signatures imparted during initial TCR signalling. Combined, our data demonstrate that the integration of quantitative TCR-dependent signalling and qualitative IL-2 signalling is essential for determining the fate of CD4+ T-cells during differentiation."
38886929,Potential role and therapeutic implications of glutathione peroxidase 4 in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder with a complex and incompletely understood pathogenesis. Despite extensive research, a cure for Alzheimer's disease has not yet been found. Oxidative stress mediates excessive oxidative responses, and its involvement in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis as a primary or secondary pathological event is widely accepted. As a member of the selenium-containing antioxidant enzyme family, glutathione peroxidase 4 reduces esterified phospholipid hydroperoxides to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. With the discovery of ferroptosis, the central role of glutathione peroxidase 4 in anti-lipid peroxidation in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, has received widespread attention. Increasing evidence suggests that glutathione peroxidase 4 expression is inhibited in the Alzheimer's disease brain, resulting in oxidative stress, inflammation, ferroptosis, and apoptosis, which are closely associated with pathological damage in Alzheimer's disease. Several therapeutic approaches, such as small molecule drugs, natural plant products, and non-pharmacological treatments, ameliorate pathological damage and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease by promoting glutathione peroxidase 4 expression and enhancing glutathione peroxidase 4 activity. Therefore, glutathione peroxidase 4 upregulation may be a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This review provides an overview of the gene structure, biological functions, and regulatory mechanisms of glutathione peroxidase 4, a discussion on the important role of glutathione peroxidase 4 in pathological events closely related to Alzheimer's disease, and a summary of the advances in small-molecule drugs, natural plant products, and non-pharmacological therapies targeting glutathione peroxidase 4 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Most prior studies on this subject used animal models, and relevant clinical studies are lacking. Future clinical trials are required to validate the therapeutic effects of strategies targeting glutathione peroxidase 4 in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

Endoscopy is favored over surgery due to lower morbidity and mortality rates. Laser lithotripsy offers precision and minimal tissue damage."
38887364,Characterization of Titanium Corrosion and Its Association With Peri-Implantitis Using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy: A Case Report.,"Dental implant corrosion is now being recognized as a contributing factor in the onset and advancement of peri-implantitis, posing significant challenges to both the durability of implants and the well-being of patients. The dissemination of titanium microparticles due to corrosion raises concerns about plausible toxicity and biological effects, especially for patients with long-standing implant prostheses. This case report focuses on the release of titanium particles in the peri-implant mucosa due to corrosion and its association with peri-implantitis. It emphasizes the critical need for strategies to minimize corrosion and alleviate its detrimental effects in order to optimize patient outcomes in the field of implant dentistry. Additionally, there is a call for research into the increasing biochemical effects of these microparticles on oral soft tissues surrounding metallic implants to enhance the longevity and clinical outcomes of implants."
38887194,A Cell Cycle-Aware Network for Data Integration and Label Transferring of Single-Cell RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq.,"In recent years, the integration of single-cell multi-omics data has provided a more comprehensive understanding of cell functions and internal regulatory mechanisms from a non-single omics perspective, but it still suffers many challenges, such as omics-variance, sparsity, cell heterogeneity, and confounding factors. As it is known, the cell cycle is regarded as a confounder when analyzing other factors in single-cell RNA-seq data, but it is not clear how it will work on the integrated single-cell multi-omics data. Here, a cell cycle-aware network (CCAN) is developed to remove cell cycle effects from the integrated single-cell multi-omics data while keeping the cell type-specific variations. This is the first computational model to study the cell-cycle effects in the integration of single-cell multi-omics data. Validations on several benchmark datasets show the outstanding performance of CCAN in a variety of downstream analyses and applications, including removing cell cycle effects and batch effects of scRNA-seq datasets from different protocols, integrating paired and unpaired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, accurately transferring cell type labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq data, and characterizing the differentiation process from hematopoietic stem cells to different lineages in the integration of differentiation data."

But they have had a problem-they take forever. That is where ChatGPT-4 and automation come in. They are like a breath of fresh air, speeding things up and making the process more reliable. ChatGPT-4 is like having a super-smart assistant who can quickly assess bias risk in research studies. It is a game-changer, especially in a field where getting the latest research quickly can mean life or death for patients. Sure, it is not perfect, and we still need humans to keep an eye on things and ensure everything's ethical. But the future looks bright. With ChatGPT-4 and automation, evidence-based medicine is on the fast track to success."
38885953,A sparse factor model for clustering high-dimensional longitudinal data.,"Recent advances in engineering technologies have enabled the collection of a large number of longitudinal features. This wealth of information presents unique opportunities for researchers to investigate the complex nature of diseases and uncover underlying disease mechanisms. However, analyzing such kind of data can be difficult due to its high dimensionality, heterogeneity and computational challenges. In this article, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for clustering high-dimensional mixed-type (eg, continuous, discrete and categorical) longitudinal features. We employ a sparse factor model on the joint distribution of random effects and the key idea is to induce clustering at the latent factor level instead of the original data to escape the curse of dimensionality. The number of clusters is estimated through a Dirichlet process prior. An efficient Gibbs sampler is developed to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Analysis of real and simulated data is presented and discussed. Our study demonstrates that the proposed model serves as a useful analytical tool for clustering high-dimensional longitudinal data."
38886409,Environmental and genetic regulation of Streptococcus pneumoniae galactose catabolic pathways.,"Efficient utilization of nutrients is crucial for microbial survival and virulence. The same nutrient may be utilized by multiple catabolic pathways, indicating that the physical and chemical environments for induction as well as their functional roles may differ. Here, we study the tagatose and Leloir pathways for galactose catabolism of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. We show that galactose utilization potentiates pneumococcal virulence, the induction of galactose catabolic pathways is influenced differentially by the concentration of galactose and temperature, and sialic acid downregulates galactose catabolism. Furthermore, the genetic regulation and in vivo induction of each pathway differ, and both galactose catabolic pathways can be turned off with a galactose analogue in a substrate-specific manner, indicating that galactose catabolic pathways can be potential drug targets."
38887470,Ten tips from the Swiss Working Group on Sustainable Nephrology on how to go green in your dialysis unit.,"The health-care system and particularly renal replacement therapy has a significant carbon footprint adding to global warming and extreme weather conditions. Improving sustainability has become the focus of national and international working groups. Many reviews underline the need for improvement of sustainability in nephrology, in particular dialysis, and provide recommendations on how to reduce waste, energy, and water consumption. However, how to implement these recommendations, and where to start, is not always clear. This paper summarizes discussions within the 'working group on sustainable nephrology' of the Swiss Society of Nephrology. We do not provide a detailed review of the topic but instead present a practical 10-point action plan to help health-care workers in nephrology make a start and improve the carbon footprint of their dialysis centres. We emphasize the importance of ongoing research, cooperation, and dialogue, and welcome additional ideas from the wider renal community."
38885862,Chitosan-based film incorporated with silver-loaded organo-bentonite or organo-bentonite: Synthesis and characterization for potential food packaging material.,"Biopolymer-clay composite films were synthesized and characterized for food packaging material. The synthesis was conducted in two stages. Cetrimonium bromide-modified bentonite (CTAB-bentonite) was first exchanged with Ag ions to obtain Ag-CTAB-bentonite. Biopolymer-clay composite films were then performed by a solution-casting method between chitosan (biopolymer) and Ag-CTAB-bentonite or between chitosan and CTAB-bentonite. Different weights of CTAB-bentonite (3 % and 5 % wt.) and Ag-CTAB-bentonite (3 % and 5 % wt.) were used during the second stage. The resultant films were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscopes, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, optical measurement, and others (moisture content, swelling behavior, water solubility, antibacterial, shredded carrot preservation, and biodegradability). Results indicated that the properties (thermal stability, thermomechanical ability, UV-visible light barrier, shredded carrot preservation) of the chitosan-based film incorporated with the synthesized composites were enhanced compared to those of the CS film. The CS/(CTAB-bentonite)-3 % and CS/(Ag-CTAB-bentonite)-3 % films exhibited antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subp. enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. The chitosan-based film reinforced with the two prepared composites can be potential for food preservation and packaging."
38887290,Case report: Overlap syndrome of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder with anti-Argonaute antibodies.,"Aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-Abs) are a diagnostic marker for patients with a demyelinating disease called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Anti-Argonaute antibodies (AGO-Abs) present as potential biomarkers of the overlap syndrome between NMOSD and other autoimmune diseases. In this paper, we present the case of an adult woman with numbness, tingling, and burning sensations in her arms and subsequent bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Brain-cervical-thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2 hyperintensities in the dorsal brainstem and around the midbrain aqueduct and longitudinally transverse myelitis with homogeneous enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced MRI. The contemporaneous detection of AQP4- and AGO-Abs led to a definite diagnosis of overlap syndrome of NMOSD with AGO-Abs. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids and immunoglobulins, and achieved remission. This case highlights a novel phenotype of NMOSD with AGO-Abs overlap syndrome, which presents with relapsing brainstem syndrome and longitudinally extensive myelitis with acute severe neurological involvement. The promising prognosis of the disease could serve as a distinct clinical profile. Broad screening for antibodies against central nervous system autoimmune antigens is recommended in suspected patients with limited or atypical clinical manifestations."
38885875,Therapeutic modulation of the kynurenine pathway in severe mental illness and comorbidities: A potential role for serotonergic psychedelics.,"Mounting evidence points towards a crucial role of the kynurenine pathway (KP) in the altered gut-brain axis (GBA) balance in severe mental illness (SMI, namely depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) and cardiometabolic comorbidities. Preliminary evidence shows that serotonergic psychedelics and their analogues may hold therapeutic potential in addressing the altered KP in the dysregulated GBA in SMI and comorbidities. In fact, aside from their effects on mood, psychedelics elicit therapeutic improvement in preclinical models of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and vascular inflammation, which are highly comorbid with SMI. Here, we review the literature on the therapeutic modulation of the KP in the dysregulated GBA in SMI and comorbidities, and the potential application of psychedelics to address the altered KP in the brain and systemic dysfunction underlying SMI and comorbidities. Endogenous and exogenous psychedelics might therapeutically modulate the KP in the altered GBA in SMI and comorbidities directly, via altering the metabolic pathway by influencing the rate-limiting enzymes of the KP and affecting the levels of available tryptophan, or indirectly, by affecting the gut microbiome, gut metabolome, metabolism, and the immune system. Despite promising preliminary evidence, the mechanisms and outcomes of the KP modulation with psychedelics in SMI and systemic comorbidities remain largely unknown and require further investigation. Several concerns are discussed surrounding the potential side effects of this approach in specific cohorts of individuals with SMI and systemic comorbidities."
38887161,Cobalt-Doped Bismuth Nanosheet Catalyst for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Electrolyte-Free Formic acid.,"Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO-) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO-2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal-doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high-purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal-doped Bi catalysts, Co-doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90% HCOO- selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0 V at a current density of 200 mA cm-2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co-doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72% after a 100-hour operation under a current density of 100 mA cm-2, generating 0.1 M HCOOH at 3.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co-doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity."

38887329,"TikTok Tracheostomy Video Analysis of Quality, Credibility, and Readability.","Objective The goal of this study is to analyze the quality, credibility, and readability of videos on TikTok related to tracheostomy in order to assess the adequacy of the information for patient and parental education purposes. Study design This was a cross-sectional analysis of online content. Methods The social media platform TikTok was explored for videos related to tracheostomy. The search function was utilized with multiple hashtags related to tracheostomy and videos were reviewed and scored for quality, credibility, and readability. Each of the videos was assessed using the DISCERN criteria, JAMA benchmark, and readability score based on text either presented in the video or written in the caption. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for each of the studied parameters. Results The TikTok search bar was queried using multiple hashtags, including ""#trach,"" ""#tracheostomy,"" ""#trachea,"" and ""#tracheotomy"" for relevant videos from October 14 to October 15, 2021. Overall, 60 videos were selected for complete review and analysis. The total views for all related videos analyzed was 17,712,281. The total likes were 693,812. The videos were primarily posted by non-healthcare professionals making up approximately 72% of all videos. Videos created by physicians generated 63% of all views. The average DISCERN score for each video was 24.83 out of 75. The average Flesch Reading Ease score was 70.59 and the average Flesch-Kincaid Grade level was 5.5. There was a positive DISCERN score and views with R = 0.255 (p = 0.049), positive correlation between DISCERN and likes R = 0.334 (p = 0.009), positive correlation between DISCERN and JAMA R = 0.56 (p=<0.0001), positive correlation between DISCERN and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level R = 0.330 (p=0.010) and a negative correlation between DISCERN and Flesch Reading Ease Score R = -0.337 (p=0.009). There was also a statistically significant positive correlation between JAMA and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level R = 0.260 (p=0.045). Conclusion Overall, the quality of the videos on TikTok regarding tracheostomy rated poorly on the DISCERN quality index but included text that was fairly easy to read. Currently, medical videos on TikTok do not meet the quality metrics needed to properly educate the public and should not be used as a primary resource."
38886879,Banff 2022 Kidney Commentary: Reflections and Future Directions.,"In September 2022, in Banff, Alberta, Canada, the XVIth Banff meeting, corresponding to the 30th anniversary of the Banff classification, was held, leading to 2 recent publications. Discussions at the Banff meeting focused on proposing improvements to the Banff process as a whole. In line with this, a unique opportunity was offered to a selected group of 16 representatives from the pathology and transplant nephrology community, experts in the field of kidney transplantation, to review these 2 Banff manuscripts. The aim was to provide an insightful commentary, to gauge any prospective influence the proposed changes may have, and to identify any potential areas for future enhancement within the Banff classification. The group expressed its satisfaction with the incorporation of 2 new entities, namely ""microvascular inflammation/injury donor-specific antibodies-negative and C4d negative"" and ""probable antibody-mediated rejection,"" into category 2. These changes expand the classification, facilitating the capture of more biopsies and providing an opportunity to explore the clinical implications of these lesions further. However, we found that the Banff classification remains complex, potentially hindering its widespread utilization, even if a degree of complexity may be unavoidable given the intricate pathophysiology of kidney allograft pathology. Addressing the histomorphologic diagnosis of chronic active T cell-mediated rejection (CA TCMR), potentially reconsidering a diagnostic-agnostic approach, as for category 2, to inflammation in interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and chronic active T cell-mediated rejection was also an important objective. Furthermore, we felt a need for more evidence before molecular diagnostics could be routinely integrated and emphasized the need for clinical and histologic context determination and the substantiation of its clinical impact through rigorous clinical trials. Finally, our discussions stressed the ongoing necessity for multidisciplinary decision-making regarding patient care."

38886374,Expert consensus on endodontic therapy for patients with systemic conditions.,"The overall health condition of patients significantly affects the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of endodontic diseases. A systemic consideration of the patient's overall health along with oral conditions holds the utmost importance in determining the necessity and feasibility of endodontic therapy, as well as selecting appropriate therapeutic approaches. This expert consensus is a collaborative effort by specialists from endodontics and clinical physicians across the nation based on the current clinical evidence, aiming to provide general guidance on clinical procedures, improve patient safety and enhance clinical outcomes of endodontic therapy in patients with compromised overall health."
38886000,Chiari malformation type III with satisfactory developmental progress postrepair.,"The authors were presented with a term female neonate with a large occipital mass, who was already being treated for neonatal pneumonia at another hospital. On assessment, apart from the mass, the patient presented with an unremarkable systemic and neurological physical examination. She underwent repair of the occipital mass, which was complicated by nosocomial ventriculitis. However, the patient was discharged well after completing antibiotic treatment. On regular outpatient follow-ups, the patient presented with a good cry, suck, and activity. There have been no reports of seizures, decrease in sensorium, aspiration episodes, stridor or any other complaints, apart from poor head and sitting control. The workup also showed profound bilateral hearing loss. Despite these complications, the patient currently exhibits good visual and social development. This is attributed to timely intervention as well as the minimal amount of herniated cerebellar tissue that the patient presented with, highlighting the individualised management and outcomes for cases of Chiari malformation type III."
38886911,GSE1 promotes the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells by downregulating KLF6 expression.,"Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent human cancers with a high lethality rate worldwide. In this study, we demonstrated that GSE1 (genetic suppressor element 1) expression is aberrantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and that GSE1 depletion inhibits the proliferation and migration of both A549 and H1299 cells. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that GSE1 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and other BRAF-HDAC complex (BHC) components in cells. The transcriptome of GSE1-knockdown A549 cells indicated that 207 genes were upregulated and 159 were downregulated based on a p-value < .05 and fold change ≥ 1.5. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that 140 differentially expressed genes harbor binding sites for HDAC1, including the tumor suppressor gene KLF6 (Kruppel-like factor 6). Indeed, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that GSE1 could inhibit the transcription of KLF6 in lung cancer cells. In conclusion, GSE1 cooperates with HDAC1 to promote the proliferation and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer cells through the downregulation of KLF6 expression."
38886924,Flare Phenomenon After 177Lu-DOTA-IBA Therapy in Bone Metastases of Lung Cancer.,"The flare phenomenon is a transient increase in the number or intensity of lesions on bone scans after treatment, signifying curative effect. DOTA-ibandronic acid (DOTA-IBA) is a new prodrug that targets bone metastases and can be labeled with 177Lu. Here, we report the case of a 58-year-old woman with bone metastasis, in whom the flare phenomenon was observed after 4 cycles of 177Lu-DOTA-IBA treatment. No adverse effects were observed during the treatment and follow-up periods."
38886364,Chromosomal-scale genome assembly of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis.,"The Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, is a significant marine bivalve species that has ecological and economic importance. This species is robustly resilient and highly invasive. Despite the scientific and commercial interest in studying its biology and aquaculture, there remains a need for a high-quality, chromosome-scale reference genome. In this study, we have assembled a high-quality chromosome-scale reference genome for M. galloprovincialis. The total length of our reference genome is 1.41 Gb, with a scaffold N50 sequence length of 96.9 Mb. BUSCO analysis revealed a 97.5% completeness based on complete BUSCOs. Compared to the four other available M. galloprovincialis assemblies, the assembly described here is dramatically improved in both contiguity and completeness. This new reference genome will greatly contribute to a deeper understanding of the resilience and invasiveness of M. galloprovincialis."
38885849,The gut-brain vagal axis scales hippocampal memory processes and plasticity.,"The vagus nerve serves as an interoceptive relay between the body and the brain. Despite its well-established role in feeding behaviors, energy metabolism, and cognitive functions, the intricate functional processes linking the vagus nerve to the hippocampus and its contribution to learning and memory dynamics remain still elusive. Here, we investigated whether and how the gut-brain vagal axis contributes to hippocampal learning and memory processes at behavioral, functional, cellular, and molecular levels. Our results indicate that the integrity of the vagal axis is essential for long-term recognition memories, while sparing other forms of memory. In addition, by combing multi-scale approaches, our findings show that the gut-brain vagal tone exerts a permissive role in scaling intracellular signaling events, gene expressions, hippocampal dendritic spines density as well as functional long-term plasticities (LTD and LTP). These results highlight the critical role of the gut-brain vagal axis in maintaining the spontaneous and homeostatic functions of hippocampal ensembles and in regulating their learning and memory functions. In conclusion, our study provides comprehensive insights into the multifaceted involvement of the gut-brain vagal axis in shaping time-dependent hippocampal learning and memory dynamics. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this interoceptive body-brain neuronal communication may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in conditions associated with cognitive decline, including neurodegenerative disorders."
38887022,Digital Twins in Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review.,"Digital twin is a new concept that is rapidly gaining recognition especially in the medical field. Indeed, being a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, a digital twin can be used to accurately represent the patients' disease, clarify the treatment target, and realize personalized and precise therapies. However, despite being a revolutionary concept, the diffusion of digital twins in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is still limited. In this systematic review, we analyzed structure, operating conditions, and characteristics of digital twins being developed for T1D. Our search covered published documents until March 2024: 220 publications were identified, 37 of which were duplicated entries; in addition, 173 publications were removed after inspection of titles, abstracts, and keywords; and finally, 11 publications were fully reviewed, of which 8 were deemed eligible for inclusion. We found that all eight methodologies are not comprehensive multi-scale virtual replicas of the individual with T1D, but they all focus on describing glucose-insulin metabolism, aiming to simulate glucose concentration resultant from therapeutic interventions. In this review, we will compare and analyze different factors characterizing these digital twins, such as operating principles (mathematical model, twinning procedure, validation and assessment) and the key aspects for practical adoption (inclusion of physical activity, data required for twinning, open-source availability). We will conclude the paper listing which, in our opinion, are the current limitations and future directives of digital twins in T1D, hoping that this article can be helpful to researchers working on diabetes technologies to further develop the use of such an important instrument."
38887472,The Burden of Invasive Fungal Disease Following Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy and Strategies for Prevention.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a novel immunotherapy approved for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. This therapy leads to a variety of immunologic deficits that could place patients at risk for invasive fungal disease (IFD). Studies assessing IFD in this setting are limited by inconsistent definitions and heterogeneity in prophylaxis use, although the incidence of IFD after CAR T-cell therapy, particularly for lymphoma and myeloma, appears to be low. This review evaluates the incidence of IFD after CAR T-cell therapy, and discusses optimal approaches to prevention, highlighting areas that require further study as well as future applications of cellular therapy that may impact IFD risk. As the use of CAR T-cell therapy continues to expand for hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and most recently to include non-oncologic diseases, understanding the risk for IFD in this uniquely immunosuppressed population is imperative to prevent morbidity and mortality."
38886375,MOC1 cleaves Holliday junctions through a cooperative nick and counter-nick mechanism mediated by metal ions.,"Holliday junction resolution is a crucial process in homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Complete Holliday junction resolution requires two stepwise incisions across the center of the junction, but the precise mechanism of metal ion-catalyzed Holliday junction cleavage remains elusive. Here, we perform a metal ion-triggered catalysis in crystals to investigate the mechanism of Holliday junction cleavage by MOC1. We capture the structures of MOC1 in complex with a nicked Holliday junction at various catalytic states, including the ground state, the one-metal ion binding state, and the two-metal ion binding state. Moreover, we also identify a third metal ion that may aid in the nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate. Further structural and biochemical analyses reveal a metal ion-mediated allosteric regulation between the two active sites, contributing to the enhancement of the second strand cleavage following the first strand cleavage, as well as the precise symmetric cleavage across the Holliday junction. Our work provides insights into the mechanism of metal ion-catalyzed Holliday junction resolution by MOC1, with implications for understanding how cells preserve genome integrity during the Holliday junction resolution phase."
38887168,Advances in the study of the glymphatic system and aging.,"The glymphatic system is cerebrospinal fluid-brain tissue fluid exchange flow mediated by aquaporin-4 (AQP4) on the end feet of astrocytes for a system, which is capable of rapidly removing brain metabolites and thus maintaining brain homeostasis, and is known as the central immune system. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system causes accumulation of misfolded and highly phosphorylated proteins (amyloid-β and Tau proteins), which destabilizes the proteins, and the body's neuroinflammatory factors are altered causing aging of the immune system and leading to neurodegenerative diseases. Damage to the glymphatic system and aging share common manifestations, as well as unstudied biological mechanisms that are also linked, such as mitochondria, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and sleep. In this paper, we first summarize the structure, function, and research methods of the glymphatic system and the relationship between the glymphatic system and the peripheral immune system, and second, sort out and summarize the factors of the glymphatic system in removing metabolites and resolving aging-related diseases and factors affecting aging, to explore its related biological mechanisms, and moreover, to provide a new way of thinking for treating or intervening aging-related diseases."
38886655,Unveiling the therapeutic potential of IHMT-337 in glioma treatment: targeting the EZH2-SLC12A5 axis.,"Glioma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system, with EZH2 playing a crucial regulatory role. This study further explores the abnormal expression of EZH2 and its mechanisms in regulating glioma progression. Additionally, it was found that IHMT-337 can potentially be a therapeutic agent for glioma. The prognosis, expression, and localization of EZH2 were determined using bioinformatics, IHC staining, Western blot (WB) analysis, and immunofluorescence (IF) localization. The effects of EZH2 on cell function were assessed using CCK-8 assays, Transwell assays, and wound healing assays. Public databases and RT-qPCR were utilized to identify downstream targets. The mechanisms regulating these downstream targets were elucidated using MS-PCR and WB analysis. The efficacy of IHMT-337 was demonstrated through IC50 measurements, WB analysis, and RT-qPCR. The effects of IHMT-337 on glioma cells in vitro were evaluated using Transwell assays, EdU incorporation assays, and flow cytometry. The potential of IHMT-337 as a treatment for glioma was assessed using a blood-brain barrier (BBB) model and an orthotopic glioma model. Our research confirms significantly elevated EZH2 expression in gliomas, correlating with patient prognosis. EZH2 facilitates glioma proliferation, migration, and invasion alongside promoting SLC12A5 DNA methylation. By regulating SLC12A5 expression, EZH2 activates the WNK1-OSR1-NKCC1 pathway, enhancing its interaction with ERM to promote glioma migration. IHMT-337 targets EZH2 in vitro to inhibit WNK1 activation, thereby suppressing glioma cell migration. Additionally, it inhibits cell proliferation and arrests the cell cycle. IHMT-337 has the potential to cross the BBB and has successfully inhibited glioma progression in vivo. This study expands our understanding of the EZH2-SLC12A5 axis in gliomas, laying a new foundation for the clinical translation of IHMT-337 and offering new insights for precision glioma therapy."
38886994,Extended Left Hemihapatectomy with Right Hepatic Artery Reconstruction for Primary Hepatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasm: A Brief Report.,"BACKGROUND rimary hepatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PHNEN) are exceedingly rare tumors with atypical clinical manifestations, accounting for less than 0.5% of all neuroendocrine tumors. Currently, there is a lack of consensus on their management, and guidelines do not recommend postoperative chemotherapy for patients with stage G1/G2 disease after curative resection. We present a case report of PHNEN, outlining its diagnostic challenges, treatment strategy, and clinical outcomes. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old man presented with jaundice and was initially diagnosed with suspected IgG4-related disease, which initially appeared to respond to steroid therapy, but manifested worsening jaundice 4 months after initial treatment. Subsequent evaluation revealed a PHNEN NET G2 with lymph node metastasis and invasion of the right hepatic artery; and involvement of the hepatic duct at the hepatic hilum, primarily the left hepatic duct. The patient underwent extended left hemi-hepatectomy with caudate lobe resection, bile duct resection, and lymphadenectomy, followed by reconstruction of the right hepatic artery. Postoperatively, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine (1000 mg bid D1-14) and temozolomide (200 mg qn D10-14) for 6 cycles. Currently, the patient remains disease free 43 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS PHNEN presents diagnostic challenges due to its rarity and lack of specific markers. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment, with chemotherapy being considered in select cases with high-risk features. Further research is needed to refine treatment approaches and improve outcomes for patients with PHNEN."
38886099,Secondary uses of electronic prescribing and pharmacy data in UK hospital care: a national survey.,"Electronic hospital pharmacy (EHP) systems are ubiquitous in today's hospitals, with many also implementing electronic prescribing (EP) systems; both contain a potential wealth of medication-related data to support quality improvement. The reasons for reuse and users of this data are generally unknown. Our objectives were to survey secondary use of data (SUD) from EHP and EP systems in UK hospitals, to identify users of and factors influencing SUD.A national postal survey was sent out to all hospital chief pharmacists with pre-notifications and follow-up reminders. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.Of 187 hospital organisations, 65 (35%) responded. All had EHP systems (for ≥20 years) and all reused data; 50 (77%) had EP systems (established 1-10 years) but only 40 (80%) reused data. Reported facilitators for SUD included medication safety, providing feedback, benchmarking, saving time and patient experience. The purposes of SUD included audits, quality improvement, risk management and general medication-related reporting. Earlier introduction of SUD could provide an opportunity to heighten local improvement initiatives.Data from EHP systems is reused for multiple purposes. Evaluating SUD and sharing experiences could provide richer insight into potential SUD and barriers/factors to consider when implementing or upgrading EP/EHP systems."

38887772,Exposure to environmental pollutants: A mini-review on the application of wastewater-based epidemiology approach.,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is considered an innovative and promising tool for estimating community exposure to a wide range of chemical and biological compounds by analyzing wastewater. Despite scholars' interest in WBE studies, there are uncertainties and limitations associated with this approach. This current review focuses on the feasibility of the WBE approach in assessing environmental pollutants, including pesticides, heavy metals, phthalates, bisphenols, and personal care products (PCPs). Limitations and challenges of WBE studies are initially discussed, and then future perspectives, gaps, and recommendations are presented in this review. One of the key limitations of this approach is the selection and identification of appropriate biomarkers in studies. Selecting biomarkers considering the basic requirements of a human exposure biomarker is the most important criterion for validating this new approach. Assessing the stability of biomarkers in wastewater is crucial for reliable comparisons of substance consumption in the population. However, directly analyzing wastewater does not provide a clear picture of biomarker stability. This uncertainty affects the reliability of temporal and spatial comparisons. Various uncertainties also arise from different steps involved in WBE. These uncertainties include sewage sampling, exogenous sources, analytical measurements, back-calculation, and estimation of the population under investigation. Further research is necessary to ensure that measured pollutant levels accurately reflect human excretion. Utilizing data from WBE can support healthcare policy in assessing exposure to environmental pollutants in the general population. Moreover, WBE seems to be a valuable tool for biomarkers that indicate healthy conditions, lifestyle, disease identification, and exposure to pollutants. Although this approach has the potential to serve as a biomonitoring tool in large communities, it is necessary to monitor more metabolites from wastewater to enhance future studies."
38887767,The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in Tehran's municipal wastewater: performance of treatment systems and feasibility of wastewater-based epidemiology.,"Analyzing municipal wastewater for the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) helps to evaluate the efficacy of treatment systems in mitigating virus-related health risks. This research investigates wastewater treatment plants' (WWTPs) performance in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 from municipal wastewater in Tehran, Iran. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured within sewers, at the inlets, and after the primary and secondary treatment stages of three main WWTPs. Within sewers, the average virus titer stood at 58,600 gc/L, while at WWTP inlets, it measured 38,136 gc/L. A substantial 67% reduction in virus titer was observed at the inlets, accompanied by a 2-log reduction post-primary treatment. Remarkably, the biological treatment process resulted in complete virus elimination across all plants. Additionally, a notable positive correlation (r > 0.8) was observed between temperature and virus titer in wastewater. Using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) technique and the estimated SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding rates, the infection prevalence among populations served by WWTPs found to be between 0.128% to 0.577%. In conclusion, this research not only advances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics within wastewater treatment systems but also provides practical insights for enhancing treatment efficiency and implementing the feasibility of WBE strategies in Tehran. These implications contribute to the broader efforts to protect public health and mitigate the impact of future viral outbreaks."
38887127,Comparison of the effectiveness of enhanced cognitive-behavioral couple therapy on emotional self-regulation and couple burnout of self-assigned and court-referred incompatible couples.,"This study aimed to investigate the comparative effectiveness of enhanced cognitive-behavioral couple therapy (ECBCT) on emotional self-regulation and couple burnout in incompatible couples. The study hypothesizes that ECBCT is efficacious in emotional self-regulation and marital burnout of incompatible Iranian couples (self-assigned and court-referred) visiting counseling centers. Twenty-eight Iranian couples were divided into four groups (two self-assigned and court-referred experimental groups and two self-assigned and court-referred control groups) who were selected using the available sampling. The experimental groups were subjected to ECBCT, while the control groups received no therapy. Over time, there was an improvement in emotional self-regulation and marital burnout in experimental groups compared with control groups. This intervention was more efficacious for the self-assigned couples of the experimental group according to the Eta coefficient, which was 71 for emotional self-regulation and 66 for marital burnout. ECBCT helps couples improve their emotional self-regulation and couple burnout."
38887487,Challenges to Implementing a Vaccine for Coccidioidomycosis.,"A vaccine for coccidioidomycosis is likely to undergo trials in the near future. In this paper, we raise 4 questions that should be answered before its use and offer our solutions to these questions. These include defining the goals of vaccination, determining who should be vaccinated, how to measure vaccine immunity and protection, and how to address vaccine hesitancy and denial."
38886572,Tumor suppressor Par-4 activates autophagy-dependent ferroptosis.,"Ferroptosis is a unique iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death characterized by devastating lipid peroxidation. Whilst growing evidence suggests that ferroptosis is a type of autophagy-dependent cell death, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating ferroptosis are largely unknown. In this study, through an unbiased RNA-sequencing screening, we demonstrate the activation of a multi-faceted tumor-suppressor protein Par-4/PAWR during ferroptosis. Functional studies reveal that genetic depletion of Par-4 effectively blocks ferroptosis, whereas Par-4 overexpression sensitizes cells to undergo ferroptosis. More importantly, we have determined that Par-4-triggered ferroptosis is mechanistically driven by the autophagic machinery. Upregulation of Par-4 promotes activation of ferritinophagy (autophagic degradation of ferritin) via the nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4), resulting in excessive release of free labile iron and, hence, enhanced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Inhibition of Par-4 dramatically suppresses the NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy signaling axis. Our results also establish that Par-4 activation positively correlates with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is critical for ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis. Furthermore, Par-4 knockdown effectively blocked ferroptosis-mediated tumor suppression in the mouse xenograft models. Collectively, these findings reveal that Par-4 has a crucial role in ferroptosis, which could be further exploited for cancer therapy."
38885961,Tracing Immunological Interaction in Trimethylamine N-Oxide Hydrogel-Derived Zwitterionic Microenvironment During Promoted Diabetic Wound Regeneration.,"The diabetic wound healing is challenging due to the sabotaged delicate balance of immune regulation via an undetermined pathophysiological mechanism, so it is crucial to decipher multicellular signatures underlying diabetic wound healing and seek therapeutic strategies. Here, we develop a strategy using novel trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-derived zwitterionic hydrogel to promote diabetic wound healing, and explore the multi-cellular ecosystem around zwitterionic hydrogel, mapping out an overview of different cells in the zwitterionic microenvironment by single-cell RNA sequencing. The diverse cellular heterogeneity has been revealed, highlighting the critical role of macrophage and neutrophils in managing diabetic wound healing. It is found that polyzwitterionic hydrogel can upregulate Ccl3+ macrophages and downregulate S100a9+ neutrophils and facilitate their interactions compared with polyanionic and polycationic hydrogels, validating the underlying effect of zwitterionic microenvironment on the activation of adaptive immune system. Moreover, zwitterionic hydrogel inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and promotes angiogenesis, thus improving diabetic wound healing. These findings expand our horizons of the sophisticated orchestration of immune systems in zwitterion-directed diabetic wound repair and uncover new strategies of novel immunoregulatory biomaterials.

38886393,"Complete genome of the Listeria monocytogenes strain AUF, used as a live listeriosis veterinary vaccine.","Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a highly pathogenic bacterium that can cause listeriosis, a relatively rare food-borne infectious disease that affects farm, domestic, wild animals and humans as well. The infected livestock is the frequent sources of Lm. Vaccination is one of the methods of controlling listeriosis in target farm animals to prevent Lm-associated food contamination. Here we report the complete sequence of the Lm strain AUF attenuated from a fully-virulent Lm strain by ultraviolet irradiation, successfully used since the 1960s as a live whole-cell veterinary vaccine. The de novo assembled genome consists of a circular chromosome of 2,942,932 bp length, including more than 2,800 CDSs, 17 pseudogenes, 5 antibiotic resistance genes, and 56/92 virulence genes. Two wild Lm strains, the EGD and the 10403S that is also used in cancer Immunotherapy, were the closest homologs for the Lm strain AUF. Although all three strains belonged to different sequence types (ST), namely ST12, ST85, and ST1538, they were placed in the same genetic lineage II, CC7."
38885874,Review of dose setting for the Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Studies (OECD TG 443): considerations on ECHA's dose level selection recommendations.,"During 2020, The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) began evaluating the OECD Test Guideline 443: Extended One Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (EOGRTS) to analyze specific aspects related to study design, conduct and toxicological findings. A significant outcome of this ECHA evaluation focused on adequate dose level selection. Subsequently, ECHA published recommendations for DART studies, however, these recommendations seemingly do not align with the principles of the 3Rs, animal welfare or human safety goals, specifically, regarding three aspects. First, the requirement to segregate testing for sexual function and fertility from the ability to produce normally developing offspring increases the risk of inadequate identification of postnatal hazards for development and sexual function and fertility, therefore failing human health protection goals. Second, the current ECHA high-dose level setting recommendations for EOGRTS exceed the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose), and therefore compromise the interpretation of the biological response relative to the intrinsic effect of the chemical under evaluation. Third, the combination of these aspects will result in an increase in the number of animals tested, increasing animal welfare concerns. This paper reflects the consensus of subject matter experts, professional, and scientific societies who have authored and signed on to this statement. The signatories encourage ECHA to adopt a revised science-driven approach to the dose selection criteria that strikes a balance between regulatory vigilance and scientific pragmatism."
38887352,Steroid-Responsive Involuntary Movements as a Remote Symptom of Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome.,"Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy that occurs in children or adolescents. To date, evidence for the management of the post-acute phase of FIRES is focused on drug-resistant epilepsy that continues from the acute phase. Information on involuntary movements, which are newly developed in the chronic phase, is limited. We report a 13-year-old boy, who had a history of FIRES at nine years of age and experienced worsening seizure control that was accompanied by unremitting involuntary　movements after two years of a fairly controlled period. The involuntary movements resulted in motor deterioration and forced him to be bedridden. Although no neuronal autoantibodies were detected, we hypothesized that the boy's neurological deterioration was triggered by an autoimmune response based on the elevation of serum anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase and serum anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and hypermetabolism of bilateral lenticular nuclei on 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography that resembled those reported in patients with other types of autoimmune encephalitis. Serial methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy ameliorated involuntary movements and improved his activities of daily living. Late-onset involuntary movements, along with seizure exacerbation, may appear in the chronic phase of FIRES. Immunotherapy could be effective in treating these symptoms."
38886986,The flavonoid quercetin decreases ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression but not SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured human lung cells.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells, via its spike protein, and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the spike-ACE2 complex to facilitate virus entry. As rate-limiting steps for virus entry, modulation of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 may decrease SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity. In silico modeling suggested the natural bioactive flavonoid quercetin can bind to ACE2 and a recent randomized clinical trial demonstrated that oral supplementation with quercetin increased COVID-19 recovery. A range of cultured human cells were assessed for co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Immortalized Calu-3 lung cells, cultured and matured at an air-liquid interface (Calu-3-ALIs), were established as the most appropriate. Primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) were obtained from healthy adult males (N = 6) and cultured under submerged conditions to corroborate the outcomes. Upon maturation or reaching 80% confluence, respectively, the Calu-3-ALIs and PBECs were treated with quercetin, and mRNA and protein expression were assessed by droplet digital PCR and ELISA, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, and the effects of pre- and co-treatment with quercetin, was assessed by median tissue culture infectious dose assay. Quercetin dose-dependently decreased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and protein in both Calu-3-ALIs and PBECs after 4 h, while TMPRSS2 remained suppressed in response to prolonged treatment with lower doses (twice daily for 3 days). Quercetin also acutely decreased ADAM17 mRNA, but not ACE, in Calu-3-ALIs, and this warrants further investigation. Calu-3-ALIs, but not PBECs, were successfully infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, quercetin had no antiviral effect, neither directly nor indirectly through downregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Calu-3-ALIs were reaffirmed to be an optimal cell model for research into the regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, without the need for prior genetic modification, and will prove valuable in future coronavirus and respiratory infectious disease work. However, our data demonstrate that a significant decrease in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by a promising prophylactic candidate may not translate to infection prevention."
38886034,Sulfonyl γ-AApeptide tools for modulating biology.,"The modulation of biology utilizing foldamers has flourished over the last few decades thanks to their overwhelming promise in their applications in molecular design, catalysis, supramolecular, and rational design. However, the application of peptidomimetics is still restricted due to the limited availability of molecular frameworks and folding propensities. To broaden the scope of foldameric peptidomimetics we proposed the development of sulfonyl-γ-AApeptides-the oligomers of sulfonyl-γ-N-acylated-N-aminoethyl (AA) amino acids, a unique unnatural scaffold that possesses promising potential to modulate protein-protein interactions. In this chapter, the overall process of design, synthesis, and function of sulfonyl-γ-AApeptides is briefly reviewed for the use of unnatural foldamers to modulate PPIs."
38887336,Severe Mitral Valve Regurgitation in Infective Endocarditis: A Case Report.,"We present a case report of a patient with infective endocarditis. He came to the emergency room with respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia and pulmonary edema. On 2D transesophageal echocardiography, vegetations were seen in both mitral and aortic valves, with mitral valve perforation and severe regurgitation. His clinical presentation and severity of the disease made him suitable for urgent valve repair. He was submitted to mitral valvuloplasty with closure of the valve perforation and insertion of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. Despite significant clinical improvement, a post-surgical complication was noted with new-onset lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass. This is an interesting case of a patient with suspected retrograde valve involvement, affecting the aortic valve, the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa, and the mitral valve, ending with mitral valve abscess with leaflet perforation and valvular regurgitation."
38887955,Impact of Social Determinants of Health on Hypertension Outcomes: A Systematic Review.,"Despite ample evidence linking social determinants of health (SDoH) and hypertension outcomes, efforts to address SDoH in the context of hypertension prevention and self-management are not commensurate with the burden and impact of hypertension. To provide valuable insights into the development of targeted and effective strategies for preventing and managing hypertension, this systematic review, guided by the Healthy People 2030 SDoH framework, aims to summarize the inclusion, measurement, and evaluation of SDoH in studies examining hypertension outcomes, with a focus on characterizing SDoH constructs and summarizing the current evidence of their influence on hypertension outcomes. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search of electronic databases identified 10 608 unique records, from which 57 articles meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed. The studies, conducted nationally or regionally across the United States, revealed that higher educational attainment, health insurance coverage, income, and favorable neighborhood characteristics were associated with lower hypertension prevalence and better hypertension control among US adults. The findings underscore the importance of addressing SDoH such as education, health care access, economic stability, neighborhood environments, and social context to reduce hypertension disparities. Multilevel collaboration and community-engaged practices are necessary to tackle these disparities effectively."

We describe a technique for robotic subtotal left pancreatectomy with preservation of the common bile duct (CBD) and spleen in a patient with multifocal RCC-PM. The patient, who had RCC and underwent nephrectomy 20 years ago, presented with a pancreatic mass. Computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated one mass at the head of pancreas (HOP), and other three lesions at neck, body, and tail. HOP lesion located near CBD. Subtotal left pancreatectomy was more preferred option than total pancreatectomy due to better endocrine function. The ultrasound-guided CBD and uncinate-preserving resection started at HOP, and then continued with distal pancreatectomy. The pathology revealed metastatic RCC with a negative margin. The patient experienced only biochemical pancreatic leakage. One month after surgery, the patient only required oral medication for diabetes treatment. In conclusion, the robot-assisted technique is helpful in increasing the success rate of organ-sparing pancreatectomy."
38886307,Spatio-temporal variability of potentially toxic elements' pollution in road-deposited sediments according to health risk thresholds: a meta-analysis.,"Road deposited sediments (RDS) are important sinks of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), which may have a significant impact on human health. A systematic review of published papers on the PTEs occurrence in RDS was carried out. The main goal was to assess the global RDS contamination by PTEs and human health risks linked with anthropogenic activities. A systematic search was made to collect information about the most cited PTEs in the published literature and perform a statistical analysis. Subsequently, health risks were assessed for 35 different areas worldwide. PTE concentrations showed high variability, and means were multiple times higher than the corresponding consensus-based threshold effect concentrations (5.2-, 10.3-, 5.3-, 3-, 7.3-, and 3.6-fold higher for Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, Cu, and Cd, respectively). PTEs concentrations were ranked as Zn > Pb > Cu > Mn > Cr > Ni > Cd. Non carcinogenic risks followed the trend Pb > Cu > Zn > Cd. Lead is responsible for the highest significant non carcinogenic risk to human health. Unacceptable exposition to carcinogenic risks is present in most areas. The top carcinogenic risk areas were Singapore > Beijing > Yixing > Shanghai > Zhuzhou for adult male, Dresden > Singapore > Ulsan > Huludao for adult females, and Dresden > Singapore > Ulsan > Huludao for children. Highest chromium and nickel carcinogenic risks occurred in Singapore, Cd in Dresden, and Cu in Huludao. Highest RDS contamination was seen in industrial areas due to pollutants deposition. Highest Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb concentrations occur in densely urbanized areas due to heavy-duty vehicular exhausts."

Though prevalent in the eastern United States of America, near the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys, the evidence underlying the global prevalence of histoplasmosis, especially in immunocompromised populations, is underappreciated. This article highlights the global epidemiology, risk factors, microbiology and pathophysiological characteristics, pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations, prevention measures, radiographic patterns, diagnostic techniques, and antifungal treatment approaches for Histoplasma capsulatum."
